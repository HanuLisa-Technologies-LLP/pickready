# Assessment flow: invitation to PRISM Report

Normative for the Tatva Assessment as built in the Vivekium simplification
release (2026-09-25). `claude.md`'s top section carries the rules and their
reasons; this document is the sequence, the settings and the interfaces the
stages call. Proctoring is `PROCTORING.md`, code execution is
`CODE_EXECUTION.md`, question formats are `ASSESSMENT_QUESTION_FORMATS.md`,
job setup (the skills a candidate is assessed against) is `JOB_SETUP_FLOW.md`.

## 1. The sequence

| Step | Where | Writes | Dispatches (after commit) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apply | `POST /portal/jobs/{id}/apply` | the link, the application's six validation fields | `parse_resume`, the confirmation email |
| Invite | `select-candidates`, the `change-status` hand move, the dashboard stage control, all through `services/assessment_invitations` | the `assessment_conversations` row (the invitation), the stage | `send_assessment_invitation`, `generate_candidate_questions` |
| Questions | `workers/tasks_questions.py`, `services/assessment_questions/generate.py` | `candidate_questions` stamped with `questions_contract_digest`; coding keys in `coding_question_keys` | nothing |
| Consent and rules | `GET/POST .../consent`, `GET /proctoring/config` | the consent act | nothing |
| Start | `api/assessment_conversation.py` | `started_at`, the contract snapshot and binding, Vaada's digest line | question rewrite if the digest differs |
| Turns | `services/assessment_conversation/turns.py` | messages, `assessment_answers`, ledger rows per answer, pauses | voice transcription, coding execution |
| Completion | the last turn | `completed_at`, the charge | `run_functional_assessment`, `index_document` |
| Scoring | `functional_assessment.run_assessment` | the evaluation (one live row), the report (insert-only), `assessment_completed` | nothing |
| Reading | `api/assessment_reports.py`, `services/prism_view` | audit rows for the PDF, transcript and citations reads | nothing |

**Applying is not being invited.** Only `invite_batch` writes an
`assessment_conversations` row; a batch asks ONE credit question for its whole
cost, and the first START asks again for one report, because an invitation is
not a reservation. A closed job or unsaved skills invite nobody.

## 2. How many questions, and of which kind

`services/assessment_questions/budget.py`, pure and deterministic.

- **Budget**: one question per skill in the contract, never below the grade's
  floor. Floors: `assessment_question_floor_non_managerial` 10,
  `_managerial` 10, `_leadership` 10, `_cxo` 8. The skills store caps a bucket
  at five, so a budget is 8 to 15.
- **Mix**, counted in QUESTIONS by largest remainder, ties to prose, then
  coding, then objective: `assessment_share_prose` 0.7,
  `assessment_share_coding` 0.2, `assessment_share_objective` 0.1 (multiple
  choice and fill-in-the-blank). N=10 is 7/2/1, N=8 is 6/1/1, N=15 is 11/3/1.
  The three shares must sum to one (refused at boot otherwise).
- **Coding eligibility**, checked in order, the first failure recorded by name:
  the job's STEM verdict (`not_stem`), a computing occupation read from the
  title (`not_computing_occupation`), a sandbox that can run code
  (`code_execution_disabled`). An ineligible role's coding share joins prose.
- **A slot the writers cannot fill becomes prose** with a recorded reason
  (`degrade_to_prose`), so the served mix differs from the plan only by a
  named degradation. Coding questions are written and sandbox-proven by
  `coding_generation.write_coding_question` (`CODE_EXECUTION.md`).
- **Nothing is pre-filled.** The resume pre-fill, the portable layer and the
  ceiling are deleted; every item is asked.
- **Questions are written against the contract.** A question row carries the
  contract digest it was written from; at the start, a mismatch deletes the
  unasked questions and answers `preparing` (a STAMPED mismatch re-dispatches
  at once, an unstamped set waits `assessment_question_redispatch_seconds`).

## 3. The start

In ONE transaction: the credit re-check for one report
(`credits.can_start_assessment`), `assessment_contract.lock_contract` under
the skills advisory lock (writes `job_skill_snapshots` version N if none, and
binds the conversation's `skill_snapshot_id` and `contract_digest`),
`log_digest("vaada", ...)`, and the `started_at` stamp. The proctoring gate
(`gate.require_active`) runs first on the start and on every answer. A
conversation whose questions are missing answers `preparing` and dispatches
after the commit; it never dispatches and then raises.

## 4. Turns and the clock

A TURN is every prompt the candidate is shown: a base question, a follow-up or
a re-ask. Opening one increments `turn_seq`, stamps `prompt_shown_at` once
(a reload returns the same turn and clock) and snapshots the allocation.

| Turn | Setting | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Prose (evidence-based, short answer), typed or spoken | `assessment_time_prose_seconds` | 180 |
| Multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank | `assessment_time_objective_seconds` | 60 |
| A follow-up or re-ask | `assessment_time_follow_up_seconds` | 100 |
| Coding | `assessment_time_coding_seconds` | 1200 |
| Grace for an answer in flight (inclusive) | `assessment_submit_grace_seconds` | 5 |

- **The deadline is computed from rows the server wrote**: the stamp, the
  snapshot and `assessment_pauses` (`device_loss`, `warning`,
  `transcription`; overlaps count once; `expires_at` caps each). While a pause
  is open the turn cannot expire. The client sends no time: `paused_ms` is a
  422.
- **Every answer, draft and voice call names `turn_seq`**; any other value is
  a 409 with nothing written. Only the current turn is answerable; past
  answers are the read-only `history`. There is no edit route.
- **After deadline plus grace the server submits what it holds**: a
  transcribed spoken answer, else the draft saved in time
  (`PUT /conversations/{id}/draft`), else nothing, which is an evidence gap
  (`answer_label = timed_out`, never re-asked). The same submission runs
  lazily when the candidate returns to an expired turn.
- **Follow-ups and re-asks**: Vaada (`ppi_interview.write_question`, context
  from `services/vaada_context` over the BOUND snapshot) writes a follow-up
  and its rubric in one call and persists only what is shown; a non-answer is
  challenged by `challenge_prompt`. The ledger is written per answer
  (`record_answer_evidence`), so contradiction probing reads a live ledger.
- **A conversation ends when its questions are exhausted**
  (`end_reason = prompts_exhausted`); there is no early close or extension.

## 5. Spoken answers

Prose turns only, offered only where `transcribe_enabled`. The capture is a
`voice_answers` row (one in flight per turn), the audio is stored through
`services/video/voice.py` under `voice-answers/` and refused above
`assessment_voice_max_bytes` (never truncated; `assessment_voice_max_seconds`
180). `pickready.transcribe_voice_answer` (Route.LAMBDA) runs after commit
with a `transcription` pause capped at the Transcribe budget
(`assessment_voice_transcribe_timeout_seconds`). A failure is a state: the
clock stays stopped for `assessment_voice_failure_pause_seconds` or until
acknowledged, then the candidate types. The transcript is FINAL. Only text is
kept: `assessment_conversation/voice_audio` HEAD-confirms the deletion of the
recording and Transcribe's output, and a failed delete is counted and retried.

## 6. Scoring: one way, four stages

`functional_assessment.run_assessment` (the persisted task name
`pickready.run_functional_assessment`, Route.ECS) is only the orchestrator. It
takes `locks.SCORING` for the application, RETURNS on an existing report,
then asks `coding_assessment.submissions.scoring_hold`, then the credit
check, then:

1. `assessment_pipeline.evidence.load_inputs`: the transcript, the answer
   locators, the structured answers, the coding evidence, the validation
   fields; `ensure_transcript_indexed` indexes the transcript inline so
   retrieval does not race the indexer.
2. `assessment_pipeline.grading.grade`: Miti (section 7), with
   `evidence_retrieval.transcript_passages_for_skill` injected.
3. `assessment_pipeline.composition.compose`: Siddhi (section 8), with
   `evidence_retrieval.support_passages_for_statement` bound in.
4. `assessment_pipeline.persistence`: the insert-only report and its rows,
   the evaluation upsert onto `uq_evaluations_live_link`, and the move to
   `assessment_completed` through `apply_transition` in the same transaction.

A stage imports only the stages before it (`test_assessment_pipeline_direction.py`).

**Not assessed is bounded.** Before attempt `miti_not_assessed_attempts` (3),
a run with a skill not assessed writes no report: the live evaluation records
`status='not_assessed'` and `attempts`, and the hourly
`release_held_assessments` re-dispatches it. On the final attempt the report
is written with those skills "Not assessed", the overall withheld when a
Must-have is among them, `scoring_mode='miti_partial'`, routed to a person,
and `miti.not_assessed_final_report` logged at ERROR (alarm
`miti_not_assessed_final`).

## 7. Miti: the interface the grading stage calls

`miti.live.evaluate_application(session, *, job, link, conversation_id,
questions, answers, locators, structured, subject_names=(),
allow_incomplete=False, invoke=None, item_invoke=None, passages=None) ->
MitiResult`

- `questions` are the link's `candidate_questions` rows; `answers` is
  `{str(question.id): [answer text, ...]}`; `locators` is
  `assessment_pipeline.evidence.answer_records(session, link.id)`;
  `structured` is `{str(question.id): AssessmentAnswer}`; `passages` is
  `evidence_retrieval.transcript_passages_for_skill` as it is.
- **G1 first**: `load_contract_for_conversation`, `log_digest("miti", ...)`,
  `hiring.gates.contract_gate` (locked, non-empty, at least one Must-have and
  one Behavioural). A failure raises `ScorecardUnavailable` before any model
  call or ledger row. Not transient: never retried as an outage.
- **Items**: `miti/items.py` grades every contract skill. Objective formats
  read `assessment_answers.auto_score`; coding reads the sandbox evidence (70
  hidden tests, 30 review; pending, unavailable or not executed is not
  assessed; empty is unanswered); other prose is `answer_evaluation` (Terra,
  temperature 0) against the stored rubric (`method=general_standard` when a
  row has none); Behavioural is one judgement over every answer about the
  skill. Passages ride in their own payload field and never raise a score by
  themselves; every skill records `retrieval` (`used | degraded |
  not_requested`).
- **Statuses** (`miti/grades.py`): `graded`; `unanswered` (25, Not Matching;
  an unanswered Must-have FAILS); `not_assessed` (no score, no grade, the
  failure class). A skill with no question issued is not assessed.
- **Aggregate**: each bucket is the `1 / priority` weighted mean of its
  ASSESSED skills; the evaluators decide authenticity, dimension floors, the
  hold, confidence and a divergence review reason, and grade nothing. The
  Must-have cap is `caps.must_have_ceiling()` (71), the one number, also read
  by the ranking blend. `grades.must_have_failed` is the one predicate.
- `allow_incomplete=False` stops after the item stage when any skill is not
  assessed (`result.outcome is None`, no evaluator paid for); `True` is for
  the final attempt only.
- **`MitiResult`**: `contract`, `contract_version`, `contract_digest`;
  `skills` (one `SkillGrade` per contract skill: `skill_id`, `name`,
  `bucket`, `priority`, `status`, INTERNAL `score`, `grade` word,
  `partially_assessed`, `items`, `passages`, `retrieval`); `complete`,
  `not_assessed_skills`; `must_have_failed`; `outcome` / `aggregate`
  (`category_grades`, `overall_grade`, `overall_status`, `stated_score`,
  `must_have_cap_applied`, `confidence`, `needs_human_review`,
  `review_reasons`); `review_reasons`; `model_calls()` for provenance.
  `SkillGrade.as_dict()` is an internal working projection, never a payload.

## 8. Siddhi: the interface the composition stage calls

In this order, with the run's `ProvenanceRecorder` threaded through:

1. `siddhi.remarks.bounded_remark(session, name, evidence, *, rating,
   provenance) -> Remark` per graded skill; `unanswered_remark(name)`;
   `not_assessed_remark()`. The Overall remark uses
   `remarks.OVERALL_REMARK_WORDS`. `Remark.source` is `model | template |
   catalogue`.
2. `siddhi.inputs.evidence_by_item(questions=, competencies=, answers=,
   answer_records=)`.
3. `gap_analysis.build_gap_groups(session, dimensions, evidence_by_item, *,
   provenance)`; every entry carries `probes_source` (`model | template |
   empty_state`).
4. `siddhi.report.compose_prism(dimensions=, evidence_by_item=, gap_groups=,
   focus_summary=, overall_summary=, overall_grade=, overall_remark_source=,
   validation=, validation_points=, claim_evidence=, extra_nodes=, passages=,
   embed=support.semantic_embedder(), passage_source=...) -> ComposedPrism`.
   Uncited statements are WITHHELD (`render_collect`) and flag review;
   `gap_analysis_json` stores `{**groups, "siddhi":
   composed.siddhi_namespace()}` (trail version 2: items, locators, support
   verdicts).
5. `siddhi.quality_gate.evaluate(...)` compares the grades the document
   RENDERED with Miti's (`miti_grades_from`); a gate that cannot run fails.
6. `siddhi.ai_score.snapshot_for_report(session, link_id,
   source=yukti.pre_assessment_snapshot)` freezes the AI Match section onto
   `ai_score_json`.
7. `model_id`, `prompt_version` and `generation_provenance_json` come from the
   recorder, so a report no model wrote names no model.

Support levels (`siddhi.support`, model-written prose only): `supported`,
`weak` (including "we could not check"), `unsupported` (flags review). The
semantic check is voyage-4 cosine against `siddhi_support_similarity_min`
(0.55); a lookup in the candidate's other answers can lift `unsupported` only
to `weak`. No similarity number is stored.

## 9. The report row

`functional_skills_reports` (insert-only: `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, trigger
`prism_report_is_immutable`, UPDATE revoked) carries `grade` (the CONTRACT's),
`overall_score` (Miti's `stated_score`, NULL when withheld),
`overall_status`, `must_have_failed`, `category_grades_json`,
`ai_score_json`, `gap_analysis_json`, `generation_provenance_json`,
`contract_version`, `contract_digest`, `model_id`, `prompt_version`,
`needs_human_review` and `review_findings_json`. `report_dimensions` carries
one row per contract skill with `assessment_status` (NULL score exactly when
`not_assessed`), `remark`, `remark_provenance` and `required_level` NULL. No
AI Score parameter rows are written; historic ones still render.

## 10. Reading the report

`api/assessment_reports.py` under `/api/v2/assessments` (the URL set issued
links carry is unchanged). `services/prism_view.report_out` is the one
serializer for the screen and the PDF. The closure gate
(`job_assessment_retention.require_readable`, 410) runs after the tenant
check. The PDF runs the candidate's retention consent, then
`siddhi.delivery.gate_delivery` (G4: a report routed to a person needs a
disposition that POSTDATES it; 409 `PDF_BLOCKED_REASON`), then
`delivery.prism_pdf`. The PDF download, the transcript and the citations are
each one audited read; opening the report is not. The citations route
resolves the stored trail's locators at read time, scoped to the application,
words only. The first section is headed "AI Match"; the payload key stays
`ai_score`.
