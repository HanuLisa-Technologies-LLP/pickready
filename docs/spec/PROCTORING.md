# Proctoring

Status: implemented 2026-09-02, per `proctoring-spec-doc.md` v1.0 (owner: Manju,
Hanulisa Technologies LLP). This file records how the specification landed in
this codebase and where each rule is enforced. The specification's seven
product principles are locked; this document does not soften any of them.

**Amended 2026-09-25 (Vivekium simplification release, `claude.md` top
section).** A lost camera or microphone PAUSES the assessment (Path P) rather
than ending it; every paused second is a row the server wrote in
`assessment_pauses`; the rules the candidate reads are served from the same
settings the pipeline enforces; the audio rules measure a second voice and
log speech during non-audio questions; every blocked paste is itemised; the
session recording arrives in segments and is purged at ninety days or the
job-closure purge (D4). The sections below are the current state.

## The seven principles, and where each one is enforced

| # | Principle | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | **REVERSED 2026-09-22.** Assessment media IS stored; the PROCTORING module still stores none | Owner ruling, verbatim: "Media storage is required. The assessment video must be compressed and stored securely in S3, linked to the candidate assessment." The browser still infers over frames in a Web Worker and posts detections only, and the analysis service still decodes audio from bytes in memory and deletes the buffer. Assessment media is written by ONE pipeline, `services/video/`, onto ONE table, `video_recordings`, encrypted at rest, retrievable only by an authorized hiring-team member inside the tenant, and reachable by both candidate erasure and the thirty day job-closure purge. `backend/tests/test_proctoring_no_media.py` was rewritten rather than deleted and now fails the build on a media write outside that pipeline, on a bucket name or object key crossing an API boundary, and on a scorer reaching the media package. P3 and P4 are UNCHANGED. |
| P2 | No human review during a live session | There is no live proctor route, no review queue and no mid-session write path for staff. Decisions are made by `services/proctoring/ingestion.py` in the request that carries the event. |
| P3 | Proctoring never affects any score or ranking | Nothing under `services/proctoring/` is imported by any scorer, by the Tatva matrix, by Miti, by Siddhi, by the dashboard or by any ranking query. `backend/tests/test_proctoring_scoring_isolation.py` asserts the import graph. The report is appended to the PRISM Report as its final, informational section and read nowhere else. |
| P4 | Proctoring is mandatory | `services/proctoring/gate.require_active` runs first in both `start_conversation` and `respond`. There is no enable flag and no role bypass. The earlier optional screen-capture consent component was removed because it contradicted this principle and P1. |
| P5 | The candidate is always informed | The rules screen renders the server's `candidate_rules` (`GET /proctoring/config`, composed by `phrasing.candidate_rules` from the same numbers the pipeline applies; no fallback text when they cannot load), and the consent screen requires an explicit "I understand and agree" and the timestamp lands on `proctoring_sessions.consented_at`, which is NOT NULL. |
| P6 | Recruiter-facing language has zero internal terminology | `services/proctoring/phrasing.py` is a lookup table; `tests/test_proctoring_report.py` sweeps every generated sentence for the forbidden words. |
| P7 | Never state or imply certainty of cheating | The phrasing library describes what was detected, never what it means, and adds context sentences where a finding could be misread. |

## Architecture as built

```
browser (all inference here)
  webcam -> Web Worker: COCO-SSD (objects), MediaPipe Face Landmarker (faces,
           count, landmarks kept in a forward-compatible shape for a future
           gaze module), face-api.js (128-d identity descriptor)
  mic    -> energy VAD -> 15-second chunks, uploaded only when speech was
           present and only when the deployment has an analysis service
  lockdown (fullscreen, blocked keys and events, focus tracking)
  behavioural capture (keystroke and pointer TIMINGS, never characters)
  -> POST /api/v2/proctoring/sessions/{id}/events   (batched, JSON, no media)
  -> POST /api/v2/proctoring/sessions/{id}/heartbeat
  -> POST /api/v2/proctoring/sessions/{id}/audio     (chunk, in memory only)

backend
  services/proctoring/ingestion.py  classifies, debounces, counts warnings in
                                    Redis (authoritative), terminates
  services/proctoring/behaviour.py  evaluates typing against the candidate's
                                    own baseline at submission
  services/proctoring/audio.py      hands the chunk to the analysis service
                                    and destroys it
  services/proctoring/report.py     generates the report once, after the
                                    session ends; joins it onto the PRISM
                                    payload and the PDF as the last section

analysis-service (separate ECS service, CPU)
  POST /diarize   pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1, speaker count only
  POST /ai-text   roberta-base-openai-detector, behind a flag, informational
```

## Every threshold lives in one place

`backend/app/core/config.py` holds every `proctoring_*` setting;
`services/proctoring/config.py` reads them once into a frozen object and
serves the browser-side subset (`CLIENT_FIELDS`) on the session response, so
the client and the server work from the same figures. No module in the
pipeline carries a literal. The specification's defaults are the settings'
defaults.

## Consequence paths (spec section 4)

`services/proctoring/catalog.py` is the vocabulary. Every event type carries
its path (A immediate termination, B the shared three-warning counter, C
logged only), its report group, whether a client may emit it, and its cooldown
or once-per-session rule. The counter is SHARED across every Path B type,
deliberately. Four identifiers were added to the specification's catalog for
rules it states in prose without naming an event: `MONITORING_INTERRUPTED`,
`INTEGRITY_CHECK_FAILED`, `IDENTITY_CHECK_MISMATCH` and `CAMERA_STREAM_FAILED`.

**Path P, the device pause (2026-09-25).** `CAMERA_PERMISSION_LOST`,
`MIC_PERMISSION_LOST`, `CAMERA_STREAM_FAILED` and `MIC_STREAM_FAILED` were
Path A and are now a fourth path, P: a loss PAUSES the assessment and its
clock. The candidate has `proctoring_device_grace_seconds` (120) to restore
the device, at most `proctoring_device_max_pauses` (2) pauses per session.
The next loss after that (`DEVICE_PAUSE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`) or a grace EXCEEDED
(`DEVICE_RECOVERY_TIMED_OUT`; the boundary is inclusive, ties go to the
candidate) ends the session as `technical_failure`, whatever caused it. A
loss shorter than `proctoring_device_glitch_seconds` (5) pauses nothing and is
stored as `CAMERA_STREAM_INTERRUPTED` or `MIC_STREAM_INTERRUPTED` on Path C.
Downgrade only: a browser cannot earn a graver path by sending a longer
number.

- **The state is the pause row, not a flag**: "paused" is an open
  `device_loss` row in `assessment_pauses`; pauses used is a COUNT of rows.
  Concurrency is a row lock on the proctoring session (`device_pause.lock`).
- **Times are the server's**: a pause opens when the server receives the loss
  and closes when it receives the recovery; a loss reported after it ended is
  dated back by its measured duration, never by more than the grace.
- **An expired pause is settled on the next thing that arrives** (an event
  batch, a heartbeat, or the hourly `reconcile_proctoring_sessions`), which
  RETURNS the termination so it commits.
- **A heartbeat gap is recorded, never a termination**: a dead network, the
  platform's own outage and a deploy look identical from the server.
- **While paused no answer is taken** (`gate.require_answerable`, 409); the
  start route returns `SessionOut.pause` so a reload lands on the pause
  screen. Every ingest and heartbeat response carries `pause: {paused,
  message, grace_deadline_at, pauses_used, max_pauses}`.
- **The browser decides none of it**: `lib/proctoring/device-watch.ts` is the
  only place a loss becomes an event; `DEVICE_RECOVERED` is sent once, when
  every device lost in the episode is live again; the integrity episode does
  not count a device the pause owns.

## One pause record for every reason the clock stops

`assessment_pauses` (migration 0125) and
`services/assessment_conversation/pauses.py` are the one implementation, with
three reasons: `device_loss` (above), `warning` (a Path B warning that does
not end the session opens one; `POST /proctoring/sessions/{id}/warnings/ack`
closes it, capped at `assessment_warning_pause_max_seconds`, 30) and
`transcription` (a spoken answer being transcribed). The turn timer reads the
union; overlaps count once. `expires_at` is a cap every reader applies; a
close may be scheduled and only ever brought forward; the partial UNIQUE index
`uq_assessment_pauses_open` allows one open row per reason. The module imports
nothing from proctoring. This replaces the client-reported `paused_ms`.

## Audio rules

- **A second voice is flagged only when it is strong.** `/diarize` answers
  `speaker_seconds` (each speaker's own total, longest first). A chunk counts
  toward `SECOND_VOICE_DETECTED` only when the SECOND entry reaches
  `proctoring_second_voice_min_seconds` (3.0), in
  `proctoring_second_voice_consecutive_chunks` (2) consecutive chunks. An
  answer without the per-speaker list is a bad answer, not "one speaker".
- **Speaking during a question that takes no spoken answer is logged, never
  punished.** Speech of at least `proctoring_speech_min_seconds` (2.0) in a
  chunk while no spoken answer is being captured (decided by the server
  against its own `voice_answers` stamps; the browser sends no capture
  window) is `SPEECH_DURING_NON_AUDIO_QUESTION`, Path C, ONE event per run of
  speaking chunks. It is listed under Audio Monitoring every time and lifted
  into the summary from `proctoring_speech_highlight_threshold` (3)
  occurrences.

## Every blocked paste is on its own line

`BLOCKED_ACTION_ATTEMPTED` carries the refused action in `metadata.action`
(`paste`, `copy`, `cut`, `drop`, others; a Clipboard API read reports
`paste`, a write `copy`). Every attempt is its own Path C row. The report
itemises paste, copy or cut, drag and drop, and everything else, in that
order, so a paste is never hidden inside a total; an unknown action is
counted under "another blocked action", never dropped. Answer fields and the
coding editor refuse the act and report it once, with its kind.

The server decides. The browser reports a mismatch; the server counts the
second consecutive one. The browser reports a focus loss; the server ignores
one under two seconds. Cooldowns are held in Redis so a phone on the desk
cannot burn three warnings in six seconds. Redis being unreachable answers
503 rather than silently issuing no warning.

## The recruiter's one setting (spec section 6)

`jobs.proctoring_warning_policy`, `terminate` or `continue_and_note`, default
`continue_and_note`. Set on the job page's setup review (the "Assessment
monitoring" card, with the specification's exact label, help text and two
options, on the job page's JD tab) and applied to every candidate on the
job. It moves no score.

## The report (spec section 7)

Generated once by `pickready.generate_proctoring_report` after the PRISM
report is written (completion or termination) or by the hourly
`pickready.reconcile_proctoring_sessions` sweep for abandoned sessions.
Stored on `proctoring_reports.report_content` as WORDS: counts are spelled
out, durations are approximate ("about half a minute"), and the only digits
are clock times in the date line and the activity log. That is what lets the
report travel inside `FunctionalReportOut` under the serialiser-level number
ban unchanged. The section order of the PRISM Report is now eight entries,
with `proctoring` last, written once per renderer and pinned by
`tests/test_prism_report.py` as before. `GET /proctoring/links/{id}/report`
calls `job_assessment_retention.require_readable` after the tenant check and
before loading, so a closed job answers 410 exactly as the PRISM Report does.
A termination orders the PRISM Report after commit.

## Retention

The platform has no time-based candidate-data purge; personal data is deleted
by cascade with the candidate or the application, and the proctoring tables
cascade the same way. `proctoring_event_retention_days` is 0 by default,
meaning "the platform's policy"; a positive value enables the hourly
`pickready.purge_proctoring_events`. Choosing a number is an owner decision
and this implementation does not invent one.

The SESSION RECORDING (not a proctoring artifact: `services/video/`) follows
owner decision D4: `video_recordings.media_purge_due_at` is stamped once at
finalize, and `pickready.reconcile_assessment_recordings` purges at
`LEAST(media_purge_due_at, jobs.assessment_purge_due_at)`, ninety days
(`assessment_media_retention_days`) or the job-closure purge, whichever is
first. The S3 lifecycle rule is the backstop, not the clock. See `claude.md`
and `docs/operations/INFRA_TOPOLOGY.md`.

## What is honest about the limits

Detection runs on the candidate's machine. The heartbeat, the integrity
self-check, server-side counting and a production-minified bundle raise the
effort for a determined technical candidate; they do not stop one, and the
code comments say so. A monitoring gap is reported as a gap, never as a clean
period. Audio analysis that is not configured is reported as unavailable.

## Explicitly not built (spec section 13)

Gaze tracking (landmark data is captured in a shape a future module can read),
AI-overlay detection, screen-mirroring detection, remote-desktop detection,
ID-document verification, session replay, a human review queue.
