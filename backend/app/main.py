# `/docs`, `/redoc` and `/openapi.json` were served unconditionally, so the full
# API surface of a multi-tenant hiring platform, every route, every schema and
# every field name, was published to anyone who typed the URL. That is not a
# vulnerability by itself, since each route still authorizes, but it hands an
# attacker the map for free and it is a one-line thing to stop.
#
# GATED ON `serves_over_https`, NOT ON `is_production`, AND THAT DISTINCTION IS
# THE WHOLE POINT. `is_production` is `environment == "production"`, and the
# deployment actually serving readypick.ai sets `ENVIRONMENT=pilot`. Gating on
# `is_production` would therefore have left the docs exposed on the live site
# while reading, in the diff, as though it had closed them.
#
# This repository has already been bitten by exactly that: `serves_over_https`
# exists because the auth cookie's `Secure` flag was tied to `is_production`,
# so pilot and staging issued cookies without it over genuine HTTPS origins.
# The property means "a browser reaches this deployment over TLS", which is the

# contextvar before anything downstream can log, so a line written by the perf
# timer, by CORS, or by a handler all carry the same id. The perf timer is
# consequently no longer the outermost middleware; what it stops measuring is
# one dict copy and a uuid4, which is not the latency anybody is chasing.

    """LIVENESS. Is this process able to serve? No dependency is touched.

    WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A WEAKER `/health`.
    ------------------------------------------------------
    `/health` below is a READINESS probe: it fails when Redis or the database
    is unreachable, and the reasoning for that is sound and is written out in
    `app/api/health.py`. A task with no Redis answers every assessment turn
    with a 503, and promoting it on a deploy would ship a broken release.

    The mistake was using that one endpoint to answer a SECOND question it is
    wrong for. The ALB target group polls it every thirty seconds with
    `unhealthy_threshold = 3`, and ECS replaces a task that fails its load
    balancer check. Redis is a single shared ElastiCache, so an outage there
    does not make ONE task unhealthy, it makes EVERY task unhealthy at once:

      * the target group empties, so the ALB answers 503 for the whole
        product, including jobs, candidates, billing and reports, all of
        which would otherwise have kept working;
      * ECS then kills the tasks, and the replacements fail the same check
        because Redis is still down, so it becomes a restart loop that also
        throws away every warm connection pool;
      * and there is nothing to route around TO, because the dependency is
        shared. Removing the tasks buys nothing and costs everything.

    A degraded assessment surface is strictly better than that.

    SO THE DEPLOY GATE IS NOT LOST, IT MOVED. `scripts/smoke-test.sh` runs
    after the rollout, probes `/health` (the deep one), and FAILS THE DEPLOY
    when it is not 200. The property the authors of `/health` cared about,
    that a release with a broken dependency does not ship, still holds. What
    no longer holds is that a dependency blip can take the running product
    down with it.

    Nothing here may grow a dependency. The moment this touches the database,
    Redis, or anything over a socket, it stops being a liveness probe and the
    restart loop above comes back.

    `scripts/smoke-test.sh` probes after a rollout, which is where a release
    with a broken dependency is now stopped.

    The probes live in `app/api/health.py`; read the module docstring there for
    why the broker is checked alongside the database. In short: an unreachable
    Redis does not raise on publish, it HANGS, so a task with a broken broker
