"""Which workspace a proven identity may enter, and the chooser that picks one.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
Firebase proves WHO somebody is (claude.md rule 2); this module answers WHERE
they may go. One identifier (an email) can belong to
several `users` rows across roles and tenants: three portals, one login. So a
proven identity resolves to either exactly one eligible user (sign them in) or
several (show a workspace chooser, carrying a short-lived single-use
`context_token`, finalised by `POST /auth/select-context`).

WHERE IT CAME FROM
------------------
Extracted on 2026-09-24 from `services/otp.py`, which mixed this LIVE logic
with the retired login-OTP flow (challenges, codes, SMS fan-out) that no route
had reached since Firebase took over identity on 2026-07-24. The functions were
moved as they were and then changed in exactly two ways, both deliberate:

* THE DUAL-OTP PENDING GATE IS GONE from `select_context`. It asked whether a
  `client` user had verified BOTH an email and a phone (FR-1.2, superseded by
  Firebase identity) and, if not, answered a pending-channel list with no cookies.
  No screen has ever handled that list, so a multi-workspace client
  with an unverified phone was stranded at the chooser. A selection now
  activates an invited user exactly as `api/auth._finalize_single` does.
* THE SINGLE-USE FLAG FAILS CLOSED. It lived in a limiter that silently fell
  back to per-process memory on any Redis error, which made a context token
  replayable across API tasks during a Redis blip without anybody knowing. It
  is now one atomic `SET NX EX` through `core/cache._redis()`, and a Redis that
  cannot answer raises `ContextStoreUnavailable` (the route answers 503), the
  posture `services/auth_sessions` already takes for the session record.
