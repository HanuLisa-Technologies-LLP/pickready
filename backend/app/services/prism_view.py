"""The PRISM Report's READ MODEL: one stored report, shaped for a reader.

PLAN-p5 WP5-F, the Vivekium release. The report route, the PDF route and the
citation route all read a report through this module, so the screen and the
PDF are built from ONE serializer and cannot disagree about a grade, a note or
a chart. It imports no grading stage: it reads rows the pipeline wrote and
never writes one, and `tests/test_assessment_pipeline_direction.py` keeps the
pipeline from importing it back.

WHAT CROSSES THE BOUNDARY, AND WHAT DOES NOT
--------------------------------------------
* A grade is a WORD, converted here from the internal score. A row the
  evaluation could not complete (`assessment_status = 'not_assessed'`, score
  NULL since migration 0130) states `NOT_ASSESSED_WORD` instead of a grade,
  with `status_note` saying why; it is never drawn on a radar and never
  projected to the bottom band, which would state Not Matching.
* `remark_note` marks a remark a fixed template wrote (the writing model was
  unavailable), and `support_note` is the citation trail's own marker for a
  remark its evidence did not clearly support. Both are the server's words.
* The AI Score of a report written from the Vivekium release on is Yukti's
  frozen snapshot (`ai_score_snapshot`); an older report still carries its
  four matching rows under the legacy category and renders them.
* `pdf_available` / `pdf_blocked_reason` come from `siddhi.delivery`'s gate in
  its non-raising form, so the screen never offers a download the PDF route
  would refuse.
