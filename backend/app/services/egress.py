"""Outbound egress control for candidate-supplied and third-party URLs
(RPN-AI-UP-001 W9.3).

THE CONCRETE HOLE THIS CLOSES
-------------------------------
`services/projects/repository.py` fetches public repositories from CANDIDATE
SUPPLIED URLs, from a task that also holds tenant data. That is a server side
request forgery primitive and an exfiltration primitive in one object.
`validate_repository_url` already refuses embedded credentials and an
unsupported host, and the tree is classified before a byte of content is
fetched, but a validator is IN BAND: it runs in the same process, on the same
string, before a redirect chain that it never sees.

WHAT IS ENFORCED HERE, AND WHY EACH ONE IS NOT REDUNDANT
----------------------------------------------------------
* **A host allowlist.** Not a denylist. The set of hosts this product has any
  business reaching is small, closed and boring, and every entry carries the
  reason it is there.
* **No redirect to a host outside the allowlist.** `follow_redirects` is False
  on the client, and each hop is re-validated from scratch. An allowlist that
  only checks the first URL is checked exactly once and then hands the
  attacker the rest of the chain: `https://github.com/...` answering 302 to
  `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` is one header.
* **Refusal of internal, loopback, link local and metadata addresses, by
  RESOLVED ADDRESS.** Checking the hostname alone is checking a string an
  attacker chose. The metadata endpoint is reachable by name as easily as by
  number, and DNS rebinding makes a public looking name resolve to
  169.254.169.254 on the hop that matters. Every address the resolver returns
  is checked, not just the first: a name that resolves to one public address
  and one private one is a rebinding attack that a first-answer check passes.
* **A bounded response size.** An unbounded read of a hostile endpoint is a
  memory exhaustion primitive that needs no exploit at all.

THE RESIDUAL WINDOW, STATED RATHER THAN PAPERED OVER
------------------------------------------------------
Resolving a name and then asking `httpx` to connect to that name is a
time-of-check-to-time-of-use gap: the second lookup can answer differently.
Closing it in Python means dialling the checked IP with the hostname carried in
SNI and the Host header, which replaces the transport for every caller. It is
not closed here. **The network layer is the real boundary**, and the Terraform
change that makes it one is recorded with this workstream: the data subnets
already have no route to the internet in either direction, and the Fargate and
Lambda task egress gets the same treatment through a VPC endpoint plus an
egress security group that permits 443 to the allowlisted prefixes only. This
module is defence in depth on top of that, in the sense W9.1 uses the phrase:
never the boundary.

WHY THE ALLOWLIST IS SHORT
----------------------------
It lists exactly the hosts reached through THIS module. The model, embedding,
payment and messaging vendors are not here, because their call sites do not go
through this module and an entry naming a host nothing checks would be a
statement about coverage that is not true. The network-layer list is broader
and lives in the infrastructure, which is where the two are reconciled.
