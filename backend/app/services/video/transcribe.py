"""Amazon Transcribe over one stored audio object, for a spoken answer.

WHY A MODULE OF ITS OWN
-----------------------
The video interview transcribed a whole recording and segmented it by question
marks (`video/processing`). That mode is retired (Appendix B section 1); what
survives is a candidate SPEAKING one prose answer, which is transcribed and
becomes the answer. The Transcribe call is the same service, the same
cross-region working-bucket path and the same bounded poll, parameterised on
the media format and the time budget, because a three-minute answer in webm is
not a two-hour interview in wav.

HONEST FAILURE, NEVER A FAKE TRANSCRIPT
---------------------------------------
Disabled (`transcribe_enabled = false`), a FAILED job, a timeout and a result
with no text all raise `TranscriptionError` with an operator-readable reason.
The caller records the failure as a STATE (`voice_answers.status = failed`)
and the candidate is told to type; nothing here ever substitutes text for
speech it could not read (claude.md rule 6).

THE AUDIO IS TRANSIENT. Only the transcript text is kept (Appendix B: "Store
transcript text only; audio lives in the session recording"). This module
reads it and the caller deletes it, HEAD-confirmed; the cross-region working
copies are deleted here, and a failure to delete one is logged, never raised,
because the working bucket's own expiry is the backstop and a transcript that
succeeded must not be reported as failed over a cleanup step.

Sync, like `video/storage`: the task runs it in a worker, never in a request.
