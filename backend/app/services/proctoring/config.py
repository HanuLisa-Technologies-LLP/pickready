"""Every proctoring threshold, in one frozen object, from Settings.

WHY A SECOND OBJECT WHEN SETTINGS ALREADY HOLDS THE VALUES
----------------------------------------------------------
`core/config.Settings` is where an operator moves a number. This is where the
pipeline READS them: one `ProctoringConfig` per process, built once, with the
browser-side subset projected by `client_config()` so the client and the server
are provably working from the same figures. A detector in the browser that
carried its own confidence threshold would drift from the one the server
records, and the report would describe a rule nobody was actually applying.

Nothing here is a literal. Every field is read from a `proctoring_*` setting,
and `tests/test_proctoring_config.py` asserts that no module under
`services/proctoring/` contains a numeric threshold of its own.
