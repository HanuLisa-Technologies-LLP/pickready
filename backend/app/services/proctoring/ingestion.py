"""Event ingestion: the browser reports, the server decides (sections 4 and 9).

THREE THINGS THE BROWSER IS NOT TRUSTED WITH
--------------------------------------------
1. THE PATH. The browser sends an identifier; `catalog.spec_for` says which
   consequence path it takes, and `classify` below moves an event DOWN a path
   when its own duration does not clear the rule the identifier claims. A
   focus loss under the ignore window is logged, not warned. A camera or
   microphone loss shorter than the glitch window is an interruption, not a
   pause. A browser cannot escalate by naming a graver identifier.
2. THE COUNT. The warning number comes from `state.increment_warning`, an
   atomic Redis INCR, and is mirrored onto the row afterwards. The browser
   never sends a count and would not be believed if it did. The same holds for
   the pause count, which is the number of pause rows (`device_pause.py`).
3. THE VERDICT. Whether the third warning ends the assessment is the
   recruiter's job-level setting, read from `jobs.proctoring_warning_policy`
   at the moment it matters and never cached in the browser.

ONE WARNING PER BATCH, AND WHY
------------------------------
A batch is a few seconds of one browser's life. A phone put down on the desk
produces one detection every few frames until it is moved, and a candidate
who has just been told to move it needs the chance to do so before the next
warning lands. The first warning-worthy event in a batch takes the warning;
the rest are recorded with `warning_issued = false` so the report can still
say how many times the thing happened.

A WARNING STOPS THE CLOCK WHILE IT IS ON THE SCREEN (PLAN-p3 3.7). A warning
that is not the end of the session opens a `warning` pause, closed by the
candidate's acknowledgement (`acknowledge_warning`) and capped at
`assessment_warning_pause_max_seconds` whether or not the acknowledgement ever
arrives. The time a candidate spends reading what they must fix is not taken
from their answer.

THE DEVICE PAUSE (the fourth path, 2026-09-24)
---------------------------------------------
A camera or microphone loss that clears the glitch window pauses the
assessment (`device_pause.py` decides; this module records and acts). Every
batch and every heartbeat first asks whether an open pause has run past its
grace (`enforce_pause`), because a candidate who never comes back sends no
recovery for anything to react to, and the answer must not wait for the
hourly sweep when a request is already here.

WHAT A TERMINATION DOES, IN ORDER
---------------------------------
Records the event, closes the proctoring session with its outcome and reason,
closes any pause still open, marks the conversation terminated so
`gate.require_active` refuses the next turn, hands
`pickready.run_functional_assessment` to the dispatcher to run AFTER the
transaction commits (so the scorer can never read a session the request then
rolled back), and returns a plain-language message for the candidate's screen.
It never deletes an answer.
