"""The proctoring event vocabulary and the consequence path of each entry.

THREE PATHS (proctoring-spec-doc.md section 4.0), decided HERE and only here:

    A   immediate termination. Proctoring itself has been defeated, so the
        assessment can no longer be considered valid. No warning, no
        recruiter preference consulted.
    B   the shared three-warning counter. Shared across every Path B type:
        a tab switch, a phone and a second person together use all three,
        deliberately, because separate counters would allow twelve incidents
        before any consequence.
    C   logged only. Never a warning, never a termination.

WHO EMITS WHAT
--------------
The browser emits what only the browser can see: detections, focus, permission
changes, its own integrity. The server derives what only the server can know:
whether an identity mismatch is the second consecutive one, whether a second
voice was heard in two consecutive chunks, whether a heartbeat gap opened,
whether an answer was typed unusually against the candidate's own baseline.
`client_emittable` says which; an event a client sends under a server-derived
type is refused at ingestion rather than trusted.

THREE IDENTIFIERS ARE ADDITIONS TO THE SPECIFICATION'S CATALOG, each for a
rule the specification states in prose without naming an event:

    MONITORING_INTERRUPTED   section 9's heartbeat gap, which "appears in the
                             report"
    INTEGRITY_CHECK_FAILED   section 9's integrity self-check, "failure =
                             event, and after 60 seconds = Path A"
    IDENTITY_CHECK_MISMATCH  one of section 3.3's two consecutive mismatches,
                             recorded so the report can say how the
                             termination was reached
    CAMERA_STREAM_FAILED     section 4.1's unrecovered stream failure

These identifiers are INTERNAL. None of them reaches a recruiter; the report
speaks in `phrasing.py`'s sentences.
