"""The sentence library (proctoring-spec-doc.md sections 7.3, 7.4 and 8.3).

TWO AUDIENCES, ONE FILE, BECAUSE THE RULES ARE THE SAME
-------------------------------------------------------
The candidate reads a warning; the recruiter reads a report. Both are plain
language, both name what happened and what the system did, and neither ever
carries an internal identifier, a count in digits, a duration in
milliseconds, a model name or a word that implies the candidate cheated. The
specification lists the forbidden vocabulary (section 7.1) and
`tests/test_proctoring_phrasing.py` sweeps every sentence this module can
produce against it, so a sentence added here without the word "flag" is a
sentence a test has read.

"Implement as a lookup, not string concatenation scattered through code."
Every template lives in a table keyed by catalog event type; the functions
below fill the table entries and spell the numbers. A caller that wants a
sentence asks for it by event type and never assembles one.

COUNTS AND DURATIONS ARE WORDS. "twice", "about half a minute". The only digits
allowed anywhere in a report are clock times in the date line and the activity
log, which `report.py` renders itself. Nothing in this file emits a digit, and
the test asserts that over the whole table at every count and duration.
