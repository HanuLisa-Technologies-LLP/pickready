"""Six-digit security codes for company registration and password security.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
--------------------------------
A security code proves that a person reads a mailbox, at the two moments the
auth spec asks for that proof (2.7): the first Company Super Admin verifying
the company email at registration (`company_register`), and anybody changing
or resetting a password (`password_change`, `password_reset`). It is NOT a
login mechanism. Sign-in is Firebase (claude.md rule 2) and the retired
login-code flow stays retired (`tests/test_login_otp_removed.py`); this module
shares none of its names, and user-facing copy calls this a "security code".

WHAT IS STORED AND WHAT NEVER IS
--------------------------------
Redis holds `security_code:{purpose}:{subject digest}` with the HMAC of the
code (keyed with the application secret and bound to the purpose and subject),
the attempt count and the expiry. The plaintext exists in two places for its
whole life: the return value of `issue_code`, which the caller hands straight
to the platform security email, and the mailbox it lands in. It is never
persisted, logged or audited. The subject (an email address or a user id) is
hashed into the key, so a Redis dump does not list who asked for a code.

THE RULES, ALL FROM SETTINGS
----------------------------
A code lives `SECURITY_CODE_TTL_SECONDS` (600), survives
`SECURITY_CODE_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (5) wrong entries, and a second one may be asked
for only after `SECURITY_CODE_RESEND_SECONDS` (60). A new code REPLACES the
previous one, so "which of the two codes counts" never has two answers. Every
attempt is COUNTED BEFORE the comparison. A right code is consumed.

FAILS CLOSED, like `services/captcha`: a Redis that cannot answer raises
`SecurityCodesUnavailable` (503), never a verdict.
