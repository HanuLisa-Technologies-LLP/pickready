"""Business Development Portal business logic.

Everything here is deliberately callable WITHOUT a FastAPI request: the query
builders are pure, the mutators take a row and a clock, and only the two
functions that genuinely need the database take a session. That is what makes
the boundary rules (search runs in SQL, agreement promotes a lead to a tenant,
a company name containing a comma survives the CSV) testable directly.

THE FOUR THINGS THAT MUST NOT DRIFT
-----------------------------------
1. Search, filtering and pagination run in SQL, BEFORE the page is cut. This is
   the same rule the Provider Portal follows: filter a fetched page in the
   browser and "3 of 108 match" starts depending on which page was loaded.
2. Ticking a progress box stamps its timestamp the FIRST time only. Unticking
   clears the flag and keeps the stamp.
3. `agreement = true` promotes the lead to a CUSTOMER, and a customer IS a
   `tenants` row (CLAUDE.md hard rule). Un-setting it never deletes the tenant.
4. The CSV is written by `csv.writer`, never by string concatenation, so a
   company called "Acme, Inc." does not silently become two columns.
