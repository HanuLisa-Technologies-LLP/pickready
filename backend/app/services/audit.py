"""Append-only audit trail writer (PRD §8 Auditability / ESD §16).

Every approval transition, permission change, profile status change, Super
Admin cross-tenant access, and — see the AUTH_* constants below — every
auth event goes through here.

Two entry points:

* `audit(...)`  — low-level INSERT that participates in the CALLER's
  transaction and returns the row. Use it where the audit write is part of
  the unit of work being committed (approval FSM, permission edits, etc.);
  a failure here is a real error and should surface.

* `record_auth_event(...)` — hardened wrapper for the AUTH request/worker
  path. It writes inside its own SAVEPOINT and NEVER raises into the caller:
  an audit failure must not break a login (or a Celery task). It tolerates
  `tenant_id=None` (Owner / candidate — a past bug crashed on exactly this)
  and `actor_user_id=None` (a failed login where no user resolved).

# RBAC 30: what an authorization-sensitive mutation must record
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# The row above carries actor, tenant, action, target and a free JSONB blob.
# RBAC 30 asks for nine more things and spec-doc6 4.1 says to add them as
# COLUMNS rather than leaving them in the blob. The reason is the Super Admin
# activity view (31): "who changed this, what did they change, what was the
# previous state" has to be answerable by a query with a WHERE clause on it,
# and a question you can only answer by parsing every row's JSON is one the
# dashboard will answer by not asking.
#
# The columns arrive in migration 0061, all nullable, so a rolling deploy has
# an old writer and a new reader coexisting without either failing.
#
# WHY THE AGENT COLUMNS ARE TWO COLUMNS
# -------------------------------------
# 34: every AI-initiated mutation must be attributable to BOTH the human
# principal and the executing agent. One column cannot hold both, and
# overloading `actor_user_id` with an agent name would make "which human
# authorised this" unanswerable exactly where it matters most. So
# `actor_user_id` stays the human, always, and `agent_name` says which agent
# executed on their behalf. An agent row with a null actor is refused by
# `record_action` rather than written and explained later.
