"""Response schemas for the client-portal video access routes (2026-09-05
Client Candidate Dashboard, Executive Profile & Proctored Video Specification,
sections 13, 15-18).

TWO THINGS THESE SCHEMAS MUST NEVER CARRY (spec section 13): the S3 bucket
name and the raw object keys. Neither type has a field for either, and
`tests/test_video_access.py` sweeps the field sets to keep it that way. The
presigned URL a delivery response carries is the ONE sanctioned way an object
location leaves the backend: time-limited, single-purpose and useless once
expired.

No candidate score, grade or rank appears here. `duration_seconds` and
`compressed_size_bytes` are operational media facts, not assessment numbers.
