"""Request and response shapes for background verification.

WHAT NEVER CROSSES THIS BOUNDARY
----------------------------------
An HR contact's email address reaches the recruiter who is running the
verification and nobody else. It is not on any list endpoint and it never
reaches another tenant: it is a third party's personal contact detail that a
candidate handed over for one purpose.

The candidate-level status is a WORD from a closed set, never a count and never
a percentage, for the same reason a grade is a word: a number invites somebody
to treat "5 of 7" as a score.
