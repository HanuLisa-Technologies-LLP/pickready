"""Auth request/response schemas (API_CONTRACT.md `/auth`, rev 2).

The one-time-code login schemas (request, verify, candidate self-registration)
were deleted on 2026-09-24 with the unrouted handlers that were their only
users. The session response they shared was renamed `SessionOut`, because it
is what every live sign-in route answers and it never had anything to do with
a code. Its JSON is unchanged except that the pending-channel list is gone: it only
ever carried the retired dual-channel gate, and no screen ever read it.
