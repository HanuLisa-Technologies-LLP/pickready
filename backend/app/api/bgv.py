"""Background verification: the candidate's declaration, and the recruiter's diligence.

TWO AUDIENCES, ONE ROUTER, AND THE SESSION DEPENDENCY IS THE BOUNDARY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
`/bgv/me` is the CANDIDATE's own employment history and runs on
`get_candidate_db`. Everything else is the recruiter's and runs on
`get_tenant_db` behind `require_capability`. A candidate can never reach a
verification record and a recruiter can never rewrite an employment claim,
because neither route exists for them.

THE PRINCIPAL AND THE SESSION MUST NAME THE SAME AUDIENCE (2026-09-24)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Until this date every `/bgv/me*` route declared `get_current_user` (staff
audiences only) beside `get_candidate_db` (candidate audience only). No token
satisfies both, so every real candidate got a 401 and Employment History was
unreachable, while every test passed because every test overrode BOTH
dependencies. The candidate routes now take `get_current_candidate`;
`tests/test_candidate_audience_consistency.py` refuses the mixed shape on any
route in the app, and `tests/test_bgv_real_candidate_token.py` calls these
routes with a real signed-in session and no overrides at all.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT
-----------------------------
There is no route that sets a verification status from email text, and no
parameter anywhere that infers one. `POST /verifications/{id}/decision` takes a
BOOLEAN A PERSON SET. The brief is explicit that HR responses are reviewed
manually, and the deeper reason is `hiring/layers.INVARIANTS`: an automated
decision here would be the product deciding a hiring outcome.

There is also no DELETE for an employment row and no PUT after finalisation.
The immutability is enforced three times over, on purpose: the database refuses
the write, the service refuses it with a sentence the candidate can act on, and
the route never offers it.

NARROWED 2026-09-18 (vivekium feature 5, owner-ruled final): after
finalisation the candidate may APPEND their newest employer through
`POST /bgv/me/employers`, and the last-two cap auto-drops the oldest row
under the one sanctioned escape (`services/bgv_maintenance`, the 0103
trigger). No edit of an existing row and no chosen deletion exists anywhere,
which is the half of the finality that survives.
