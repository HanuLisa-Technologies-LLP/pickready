"""Business Development Portal, the fourth portal (`/bd` UI, `/bd` API).

    Provider Portal   the PickReady owner's console over its customers
    Customer Portal   a client company's own dashboard
    Candidate Portal  the public candidate surface
    BD Portal         this module: the team that FINDS the customers

Four pages: BD Reach, AI Reach, Customers, Settings. BD Reach was two screens
(Personal Reach and Social Reach) until 2026-08-09; they were always the same
funnel over one `bd_leads` table discriminated by `channel` (see models/bd.py
for why one table, not two), so the merge is a UI consolidation and the column
is unchanged. Omitting `channel` on the list has always meant "both", and that
is now what the screen sends.

SESSION AND PERMISSIONS
-----------------------
A BD rep is PickReady staff, not a customer's staff: they have no `tenant_id`,
and the leads they work belong to no tenant. So this router uses the OWNER
token audience (the same portal family as the Provider console) and the RLS
BYPASS scope, with an `audit_log` row written for every request exactly as
`get_superadmin_db` does. `bd_leads` still has an RLS policy that requires
`app.bypass_rls = 'on'` (migration 0023), so an org or candidate session cannot
read PickReady's own sales pipeline. RLS is the boundary; the handler filters
are defence in depth (CLAUDE.md rule 1).

Gating is `require_bd_capability(...)`, resolved through the same data-driven
RBAC engine every other portal uses. There is no `if role == "bd"` anywhere in
this file, and the `bd` role holds nothing this file grants it in code: the
grants are rows in `role_permissions` (CLAUDE.md rule 3).

NO EM DASHES in any user-facing string, including the error details below.
