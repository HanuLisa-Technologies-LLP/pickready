"""Company self-registration: `/api/v1/company-onboarding` (owner spec 2.2, 5, 24).

    POST /register             details + CAPTCHA -> a security code (or a notice)
    POST /code/verify          the code -> onboarding tenant, invited client, cookie
    POST /code/resend          a new code for a registration already started
    GET  /state                where this browser's registration stands (derived)
    GET  /monthly/plans        the paid Starter pilot
    POST /monthly/subscribe    create its Razorpay subscription
    POST /monthly/verify       verify captured charge before activation
    POST /activate             password (or an existing sign-in) -> org session

WHO IS ASKING, AND HOW THAT IS PROVEN
-------------------------------------
Nobody here has a portal session, and until the code is verified there is no
tenant at all. So the proofs are, in order: a single-use CAPTCHA proof
(`company_register`) before any email is sent; the six-digit security code
from the mailbox before any tenant is created; then the ONBOARDING COOKIE
(`services/company_onboarding`, its own audience, sixty minutes) for every
later step, each of which reads the ONE registration the cookie names. The
activation additionally requires a PAID charge, read from `billing_transactions`
(rule 8), so a password can never be set for a company that has not paid.

WHY THE BYPASS SESSION, AND WHY IT IS SAFE
------------------------------------------
`company_registrations` exists before its tenant, so no tenant session could
write it, and the tenant a verification creates is not reachable by an org
session until activation. Every route therefore runs on `get_onboarding_db`,
the explicit RLS bypass scope, and every handler filters by the exact
registration its proof names (the email it was sent to, or the cookie's id),
never by anything else in the body. Writes commit EXPLICITLY before the
response is built, so a cookie or a session is never handed out for a row
that rolled back afterwards.

ONE MONTHLY SETTLEMENT PATH
---------------------------
The onboarding verification and Razorpay webhook both call
`monthly_plans.settle_charge`; its payment id guard grants one month once.

ENUMERATION
-----------
`/register` and `/code/resend` answer the same sentence and start the same
resend window whether or not the address already has an account; an address
that does receives the platform `account_exists_notice` instead of a code.
