"""Firebase identity exchange, workspace selection and the session lifecycle.

Firebase proves identity; Vivekium remains authoritative for application
roles, tenant isolation, capabilities, and its portal-scoped sessions.
`services/login_context` decides which workspaces a proven identity may enter.

The retired one-time-code login handlers (candidate self-registration, code
request, code verification) sat here without a route for two months after
Firebase took over identity, and were deleted on 2026-09-24 with the schemas
only they used. `tests/test_login_otp_removed.py` keeps them gone.
