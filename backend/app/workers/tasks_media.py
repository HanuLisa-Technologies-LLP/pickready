"""The session recording tasks: processing, repair, and the retention purge.

Carved out of `workers/tasks.py` on 2026-09-24 (PLAN-p3 WP0) and rebuilt in
the same release (PLAN-p3 WP5). `workers/tasks.py` imports this module so
importing the registry still registers every task.

    pickready.process_assessment_video        Route.ECS, one recording
    pickready.reconcile_assessment_recordings Route.LAMBDA, hourly repair
    pickready.purge_assessment_media          Route.LAMBDA, hourly retention

The processing task keeps its name for queued-message compatibility although
the video-interview half it used to carry is deleted.

    A recording is purged at whichever comes first of its stored

    job's stored closure purge date. It asks the TABLE for both
    (`media_retention.due_recordings`), never a constant, and every deletion
    is HEAD-confirmed. The ROW survives with `media_deleted_at` stamped, so
    the record still says a recording existed and that its media is gone.

    One recording at a time, committing as it goes: a single transaction over
    the whole backlog would roll back deletions the object store has already
    performed and leave the counters disagreeing with the store. A deletion
    that does not confirm is counted and comes back next hour; there is no

def reconcile_assessment_recordings():
    """Hourly repair of the recording pipeline. Five passes, each asking the
    TABLE rather than trusting that an earlier step happened:

    1. RAW DELETIONS THAT DID NOT CONFIRM. A stored (`ready`) recording whose
       raw segment objects were not all HEAD-confirmed gone. Before this
       sweep a failed deletion incremented `raw_delete_failures` and nothing
       ever looked at the row again, so the raw bytes of a candidate's session
       sat in the bucket until the lifecycle rule found them. Past
       `ATTEMPTS_BEFORE_ALARM` the log line becomes an error.
    2. ORPHANED RECORDINGS. A tab closed mid-session never calls finalize.
       Once the session is over and nothing has arrived for the grace, the
       recording is finalized from the STORE's own list of parts and handed
       to processing, so a session is stored even when its browser vanished.
    3. FINALIZED RECORDINGS NO RUN PICKED UP. A finalize dispatches after its
       commit and a lost invoke is logged rather than raised; this re-hands
       a recording still `uploaded` after the grace.
    4. RUNS THAT DIED WITHOUT SAYING SO. A processing task killed from
       outside leaves its row in `compressing` or `storing` for ever. Past
       every bound the pipeline runs under (`processing_stall_after`), the
       row is given the failure state of its step, logged at ERROR, and
       becomes retryable by the hiring team, instead of waiting silently
       while the bucket's raw rule deletes the only copy.
    5. SPOKEN-ANSWER AUDIO. A voice answer whose first deletion could not be
       confirmed, or whose transcription never reported back (failed first
       through the same stale rule the routes apply), is deleted and
       HEAD-confirmed by `voice_audio.repair_pending_audio`; an unconfirmed
       deletion is counted on the row and tried again next hour (p3-w5
       hunk 2, applied at the stage 2 integration).

    Dispatches happen AFTER the commit that makes the rows they read durable.

    ONE RECORDING AT A TIME, AND ONE FAILURE STAYS ONE FAILURE. Completing an
    orphan calls the object store, and a store error for one recording rolls
    back that recording's work, is logged at ERROR with its class, and the
    pass moves on: the row is still `recording`, so the next hour tries it
    again. Rows are re-read by id after every commit or rollback, because a
    rollback expires every loaded row and an expired row read in an async
    session is an implicit query the driver refuses.
