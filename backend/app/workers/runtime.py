"""The one place a background task is actually executed.

Every entry point converges here: the generic worker Lambda, the on-demand
Fargate task, and the in-process thread the docker-compose stack uses. There is
one implementation of "resolve a name, open a session, run it, retry it, record
what happened", so a task cannot behave differently depending on which door it
came through.

THE RETRY LOOP PREDICTS, IT DOES NOT MERELY OBSERVE
---------------------------------------------------
Before starting attempt N+1 the loop asks whether that attempt could FINISH
inside the remaining budget, using the longest attempt seen so far as the
estimate. `elapsed >= deadline` is the check that sounds right and is not: a
task whose attempts take eighty seconds under a hundred-second budget starts a
second attempt at eighty seconds and is killed by the platform at a hundred,
having thrown away the work of both. This is the same rule `agent_loop` and
`llm_router` already state, applied to the outer loop.

THERE IS NO SOFT TIME LIMIT ANY MORE, AND THAT IS A SIMPLIFICATION
------------------------------------------------------------------
Celery had two ceilings: a soft one that raised inside the task and a hard one
that killed it. The soft limit existed to turn a hang into a retryable
exception, and the lesson this codebase then recorded was that retrying a
timeout is exactly wrong, so `SoftTimeLimitExceeded` had to be added to a
no-retry exclusion list to undo the thing the soft limit was for.

Now the ceiling belongs to the platform, and the two platforms differ:

  Lambda  a hard function timeout. A task that outruns it is killed, and no
          retry is attempted, because the retry loop lives inside the
          invocation that was killed. The exclusion list is gone because
          nothing needs excluding: a task that could not finish in its budget
          will not finish in another one.

  Fargate NO ceiling. An on-demand task runs until its process exits, and
          `stopTimeout` is a SIGTERM grace period rather than a limit on the
          work. `DEFAULT_BUDGET_SECONDS` below is a self-imposed bound on the
          RETRY LOOP for that case, and it never cuts an attempt short.

WHAT A FAILURE COSTS
--------------------
The final failure is recorded in the run status and logged, and then it is
RE-RAISED. The Lambda invocation fails, which is what makes the function's
error metric move, the CloudWatch alarm fire and the on-failure destination
publish. Swallowing it here would leave the platform believing every
invocation succeeded, which is the reporting failure this product has already
been bitten by from the other direction.
