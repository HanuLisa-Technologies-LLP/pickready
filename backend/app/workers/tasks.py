All slow work happens here, never inline in a request handler (claude.md rule
4). A task is a plain synchronous function running async service code through
`asyncio.run`, with a FRESH engine per run: an execution environment is frozen
between invocations and a pooled connection does not survive the freeze, so a
shared engine hands the next run a socket that looks healthy and fails on use.

`@task` records the name, the destination and the retry policy in ONE
declaration (see `registry`). `Route.LAMBDA` is work measured in seconds;
`Route.ECS` is work measured in minutes, which runs as one on-demand Fargate
task per dispatch and stops when the process exits.

Retries live in `runtime.run_task`, inside the invocation, and the platform's
asynchronous retry is set to zero so the two cannot multiply. There is no soft
time limit any more: the ceiling is the Lambda's timeout or the Fargate task's
`stopTimeout`, and because the retry loop lives inside the thing that gets
killed, a task that outran its budget is not retried. That is the behaviour the
`dont_autoretry_for` exclusion list used to buy, now structural.

SECURITY (ESD §16): OTP codes and API keys are NEVER logged or written to
audit metadata. Email `context` payloads may contain OTPs and are therefore
never persisted or logged, only template/recipient/status metadata is.

    if the row is still the one that was asked about: a human save meanwhile
    wins, and the generation stands down at INFO.

    ONE attempt. A failed generation is a STATE the team retries from the tab;
    retrying here would spend a second model call on a row the failure already
    moved to `failed`. The failure is committed, then re-raised, so the
    function's error metric moves. A lost invoke needs no sweep: a
    `generating` row past `swot_generation_stale_minutes` reads as failed.

    RLS: the worker session bypasses RLS like every task today; this one reads
    and writes one tenant's job and SWOT row, and is a candidate for the tenant
    worker session when Phase 7 lands it.

    HELD, NOT FAILED, WHEN THE CREDIT POOL IS EMPTY (spec §11)
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    A candidate already inside an active conversation when the pool hits zero is
    not cut off mid-session: that one conversation runs to completion. Its
    credit is drawn at finalisation exactly as any other completion is, and if
    the pool is still at zero when finalisation is reached, finalisation itself
    is blocked pending top-up.

    "Blocked" means the report is not written and the task RETURNS, rather than
    raising. Raising would burn the five autoretries against a condition no
    retry can fix and then dead-letter the work permanently; returning leaves a
    completed conversation with no report, which is precisely the state
    `pickready.release_held_assessments` looks for when a bundle is purchased.

    Nothing is lost by waiting. The transcript is the evidence and it is already
    stored; the report is written from it whenever the customer tops up.

    ONE RUN PER APPLICATION, ENFORCED ACROSS PROCESSES
    ---------------------------------------------------
    Five call sites dispatch this task: the assessment route, proctoring
    ingestion, the video pipeline, the credit-hold release sweep and the
    reconciler. `Route.ECS` starts one Fargate container per dispatch, so two of
    them firing for one application are two processes sharing nothing but the
    database, and `services/coalescing` cannot see across that boundary by its
    own stated design.

    `uq_functional_report_link` already stops two REPORTS existing. What it does
    not stop is the cost and the damage of getting there. Both runs spend Miti's
    five evaluators and Siddhi's synthesis before the constraint fires at
    COMMIT; the loser then raises, and `max_attempts=2` runs the entire chain
    again; and on that retry the row EXISTS, so the writer takes its UPDATE
    branch and rewrites a report that may already have been delivered. Reports
    are immutable in this product and a retake writes a NEW report beside the
    old one, so a race rewriting one in place is that rule failing without a
    sound.

    So the second run RETURNS. That is not an error and not a degradation: the
    first run is doing exactly what the second came to do. The lock is
    transaction scoped, released by this task's own commit or by the rollback
    that replaces it, with no `finally` to forget and no leak when a container
    is killed mid-run.

    RESUMABLE, AND THE THIRD ARGUMENT IS WHAT MAKES IT SO. Called with a

    was left: `pending` means the database half never ran, `rows_erased` means
    only the objects are outstanding, `completed` means somebody else finished
    it and this call is a redelivery. Called without one, as the AI runtime's
    own call sites do, it opens its own record first, so there is exactly one
    shape of erasure in the product rather than an orchestrated one and a bare
    one that forgets the files.

    A handful of statements, a Redis scan and a bounded set of object deletes,
    so Lambda.

    THE VECTORS ARE THE POINT. An embedding is not a one-way hash: published
    inversion work recovers 50 to 70% of input words from popular sentence
    embeddings, and because the model is public and queryable, a dictionary
    attack against stolen vectors is practical. An erasure that deleted the
    rows and left `profiles.embedding` behind would leave the candidate's
    resume recoverable from a column nobody thinks of as personal data.

    `worker_session` runs with `app.bypass_rls = 'on'`, which this needs: a
    candidate spans tenants via the databank, and their chunks may sit under a
    tenant the erasing operator is not scoped to.

    THE STATE THIS EXISTS FOR IS `rows_erased`: the person is out of the
    database and some of their stored files are not out of the object store.
    Before the deletion record existed that state was not merely unrepaired,
    it was UNDETECTABLE: the erasure was one inline transaction, the objects
    were never touched at all, and nothing anywhere held a list of what was
    owed.

    It asks the TABLE, never a timestamp, which is the rule
    `reconcile_context_index` states and the reason
    `reconcile_project_intake` exists in the same shape: a dispatch that never
    arrived leaves no trace, so the only durable record of outstanding work is
    the row that describes it.

    NEVER GIVES UP. There is no attempt ceiling and no terminal failure state,
    because "we stopped trying to delete this person's documents" is not an
    outcome this product may reach. What a persistent failure moves is the
    attempt counter, and past `ATTEMPTS_BEFORE_ALARM` the log line becomes an
    error so a stuck request is loud rather than merely present.

    ONE REQUEST AT A TIME, COMMITTING AS IT GOES, the consent sweep's rule: a
    single transaction over the whole backlog would roll back the deletions it
    had already confirmed and leave counters that disagree with the store.

    every read and every deduction, so running late costs a stale number on an
    idle account and can never let an expired credit be spent.

    Committing per tenant, the consent sweep's rule: a tenant's lot zeroing

    `dashboard_job_metrics` aggregates `jobs` and `job_candidate_links`, both of

    empty aggregate is a perfectly valid result. Measured on production before
    this fix, the view held 0 rows against 35 live jobs, and every dashboard
    reading it rendered blank behind a clean 200.

    Setting the flag is correct rather than a workaround: this is the same
    audit-logged cross-tenant escape hatch the policies define, and a
    platform-wide aggregate is cross-tenant BY DEFINITION. The view is never
    served raw  -  `api/dashboard` filters it by the caller's tenant.

    The sentinel tenant is pinned alongside it for the reason set out in
    `core/db.superadmin_scope`: `current_setting` is STABLE, so the planner
    constant-folds the policies' `::uuid` cast before the bypass OR is ever
    evaluated, and an empty-string GUC therefore raises during planning no
    matter what the bypass flag says. Migration 0034 guards the cast with
    nullif() so this can no longer bite, but pinning the sentinel keeps the task
    correct even against an unmigrated database.

    a fan-out that told nobody and a fan-out that told everybody produce the
    same empty log otherwise, which is the failure `dispatch` raising was added
    to make visible.

    NOTHING ABOUT A CANDIDATE IS IN THE PAYLOAD, and nothing could be. The
    email carries the thread's subject, the customer's name and a link. The
    message BODY is deliberately not included: it is free text a human typed,
