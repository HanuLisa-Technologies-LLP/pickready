"""The proctoring tasks: the per-application report and the hourly reconciler.

Carved out of `workers/tasks.py` on 2026-09-24 (PLAN-p3 WP0) as a PURE MOVE:
task names, routes and retry policies are unchanged, and `workers/tasks.py`
imports this module so importing the registry still registers every task.
`pickready.purge_proctoring_events` stays in `workers/tasks.py`.

    1. The conversation completed but the session is still active. The report
       task was enqueued and lost (broker hiccup, worker restart). Re-enqueue
       it; it closes the session itself.
    2. A camera or microphone pause ran past its grace and no request came
       back to settle it: the candidate closed the tab while paused. The
       session ends exactly as a live request would have ended it
       (`ingestion.enforce_pause`, `DEVICE_RECOVERY_TIMED_OUT`, a technical
       failure), and that path orders the PRISM Report after this commit.
       Checked BEFORE abandonment: the rules the candidate was shown ended it
       two minutes into the pause, not hours later.
    3. The conversation never completed and the session has heard nothing for
       `credit_reconciliation.SETTLE_AFTER_HOURS`. The candidate closed the
       tab and did not return. The session is ended as `abandoned` and its
       report is enqueued. The clock is deliberately the credit reconciler's,
       so an assessment is never "abandoned" for proctoring while still
       "open" for billing, or the reverse.

    A technical failure is NOT decided here. It is decided at termination
    time by `ingestion.outcome_for_termination`, which has the reason in
    hand; re-reading it from a row later would be a second implementation.
