"""The spoken-answer transcription task.

`pickready.transcribe_voice_answer` turns one uploaded recording into the
candidate's answer text. Route.LAMBDA: a three-minute answer is a ten to sixty
second Transcribe job, bounded by `assessment_voice_transcribe_timeout_seconds`
well inside the task worker's timeout, and it must not wait behind a Fargate
cold start while the candidate's clock is paused.

WHAT IT PROMISES
----------------
- The transcript is FINAL and becomes the answer (Appendix B). Nothing edits it.
- A failure is a STATE, never a fake transcript: `status = failed` with an
  operator reason, and the candidate's clock stays paused for
  `assessment_voice_failure_pause_seconds` (or until they acknowledge) so they
  can read what happened and type instead.
- The AUDIO is deleted, HEAD-confirmed, whatever happened
  (`assessment_conversation.voice_audio`). A delete that cannot be confirmed
  is COUNTED on the row (`audio_delete_failures`) and the hourly repair pass
  retries it; there is no terminal failure state.
- Idempotent: a redelivered message for a row that is no longer waiting does
  nothing, and each attempt uses its own Transcribe job name.

It runs in the worker's bypass-RLS session (a background task operating on one
named row), and every query names that row.
