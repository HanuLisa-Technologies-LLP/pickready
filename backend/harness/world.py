"""Named world builders: the initial state a scenario stands on.

WHY A NAME AND NOT SQL IN THE SCENARIO
----------------------------------------
HARNESS.md section 2 states the rule this module exists to enforce: "A scenario
names a world builder, it does not inline SQL. Builders live in
`harness/world.py` and are shared. A scenario that builds its own state is a
scenario nobody can compose."

The practical consequence is that a world is a PRODUCT of smaller seeds rather
than a copy of the one above it. `single_tenant_job_with_applicant` is
`single_tenant_published_job` plus a candidate, and that composition is why
adding a column to `jobs` is one edit here rather than nine near-identical
inserts across a scenario directory.

WHY THE SEEDS ARE RAW SQL AND NOT THE ORM
-------------------------------------------
Every insert below runs under `superadmin_scope`, in explicit SQL, naming its
columns. That is the shape `tests/skills_fixtures.py` and
`tests/test_audit_single_insert_api.py` already use, and it is deliberate: the
ORM would apply defaults, validators and event hooks that the PRODUCT applies
on the write path, and a world that got its rows through the same machinery
being tested cannot establish a state the product would refuse to create. A
scenario that wants a job whose skills the team emptied, while the draft state
still says no draft was ever asked for (audit number 8), needs exactly that.

THE SCHEMA PREFLIGHT, AND WHY A MISSING RELATION IS `unavailable`
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Each builder declares the relations its world and its workload will touch.
`preflight` asks the catalog for them BEFORE anything is inserted, and a
missing one aborts the build with `SchemaMissing` rather than with whatever
`UndefinedTableError` the first insert happens to raise. The runner turns that
into `unavailable`, never `fail`, because a database that has not been migrated
far enough has told us nothing about the product: reporting it as a failure
would put a red scenario in front of somebody whose fix is `alembic upgrade
head`, and reporting it as a pass is the green-while-broken outcome the whole
harness exists to prevent.

NOTHING HERE IS CLEANED UP BY TRUNCATION
------------------------------------------
`teardown` deletes the tenant and lets the foreign keys cascade, plus the
handful of rows that are deliberately tenant-free (`candidates`, `profiles`,
which span tenants through the databank). Truncating tables would destroy the
rows every other agent working against this shared stack is relying on.
