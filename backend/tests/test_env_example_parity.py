"""`.env.example` and `Settings` describe the same configuration surface.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`.env.example` is the one place an operator learns what a deployment can set,
and it had drifted from `app/core/config.Settings` in BOTH directions. Keys
the product reads were missing (`INBOUND_EMAIL_DOMAIN`,
`INBOUND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `POSTGRES_MIGRATION_ROLE`, `COOKIE_DOMAIN`,
`SES_CONFIGURATION_SET`, the four `TRANSCRIBE_*`), several of which the pilot
Terraform sets, so a laptop could not reproduce the deployed configuration
without reading the Python. And keys the product no longer read were still
there (`SENDER_OTP_*` two weeks after the mailbox code went, the Cloud Run
block a platform after Cloud Run went, the SMS vendor keys and `OTP_*` with no reader),
each one a setting an operator could tune expecting an effect.

WHAT IS PINNED
--------------
* Every `Settings` field is documented in `.env.example` (as `KEY=value`, or
  as `# KEY=value` when leaving it unset is the point), OR it is declared in
  `INTERNAL_ONLY` under a written reason. Nothing is exempt by prefix: a
  new field is a decision, and this file is where it is recorded.
* Every key in `.env.example` is a `Settings` field, or a key declared in
  `EXTERNAL` with the process that reads it.
* The declarations are a RATCHET: a name in `INTERNAL_ONLY` that is no longer
  a field, or that is also documented, fails; so does an `EXTERNAL` key the
  file no longer carries or that has become a field.
* Every `Settings` field a Terraform environment root SETS is documented,
  never internal. A value a deployment actually sets is deployment data by
  definition, and hiding it in the internal list is how a laptop stops
  resembling the pilot.
