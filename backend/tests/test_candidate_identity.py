"""One person, one candidate record, resolved one way.

WHAT THIS PINS
--------------
`services/candidate_identity` replaced four resolvers that disagreed. The
dangerous one matched `candidates.email = users.email` at REQUEST time on an
address nobody had verified, so a password sign-up carrying somebody else's
address read that person's recruiter-sourced record. The rules now:

* a request resolves by `user_id` only;
* an email match links a record at SIGN-IN, only when Firebase says the
  address is verified, and it links the OLDEST unlinked record;
* an unverified identity gets its own record and links nothing;
* one user owns at most one record, by a UNIQUE index (migration 0121).

Every database assertion reads committed state on a SECOND session after the
call under test has committed, because a write that answered and then rolled
back is invisible to anything that shares its transaction.

The AST sweep at the bottom keeps new request-time resolvers from appearing,
with a ratchet over the legacy ones still owned by other work packages.
