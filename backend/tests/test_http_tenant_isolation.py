"""Cross-tenant reads, writes and deletes, through the REAL product routes.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS WHEN `test_cross_tenant_isolation.py` ALREADY PASSES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
That file proves the DATABASE refuses a cross-tenant row: it seeds two graphs,
enters `tenant_scope`, and checks that a SELECT returns only its own. It is the
right test for the RLS policies and it says nothing at all about the product.

A route can defeat every one of those policies without touching them. It can
read through `get_superadmin_db`. It can look a row up by a column the policy
does not key on. It can take the tenant from the request instead of the
session. It can answer 403 where it should answer 404, which discloses that
the row exists to somebody who may not read it. None of that is visible from
a SQL-level test, and the ones that ARE tested at route level today
(`test_conversations_api`, `test_support_flow`, `test_bgv_api`,
`test_dashboard_rbac_matrix`) cover four surfaces out of the product.

The gap this closes is the rest: jobs, candidate profiles, project evidence,
reports, resume downloads and application archiving, over READ, UPDATE and
DELETE, through `app.main.app` with real routers and the real RLS session.

404, NEVER 403, AND THAT IS THE ASSERTION
------------------------------------------
Every case asserts the exact status. A 403 on a resource in another customer's
tenant CONFIRMS THE ID IS REAL to a caller who has no business knowing that,
and the difference between 403 and 404 is the whole of what an enumeration
attack needs. `assert response.status_code == 404` rather than
`assert response.status_code != 200` for the same reason: a 500 is also not a
200, and a stack trace is not an access control.

THE CALLER IS DELIBERATELY OVER-PRIVILEGED
--------------------------------------------
Each request is made as a Super Admin of tenant A, holding every capability
their role grants. A test that used an under-privileged caller would collect
403s from the capability gate and prove nothing about the tenant boundary: the
refusal has to come from the boundary itself, so the caller is given every
reason to succeed except the one that matters. The paired "tenant A reaches
its OWN copy of the same resource" assertion in each test is what proves the
404 is isolation rather than a fixture that never worked.
