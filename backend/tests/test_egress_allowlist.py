"""Egress control for candidate-supplied and third-party URLs (W9.3).

The hole this closes is concrete: `services/projects/repository.py` fetches
public repositories from CANDIDATE SUPPLIED URLs, from a task that also holds
tenant data. Every test here is written against that shape rather than against
an abstract SSRF: an attacker who controls a URL, a DNS answer, or a redirect
header, and a service that must not connect to the result.

DNS IS ALWAYS STUBBED. A test that resolved a real name would be a test that
passes or fails on somebody's resolver, and the rebinding case cannot be
expressed at all without controlling the answer.
