"""Signing in as the invited user accepts the invitation (PR #5 item 5, ported).

THE REPORTED SYMPTOM
--------------------
A Recruiter had been signed in and working for weeks while the staff table
still reported their invitation as "Pending". `users.status` is flipped
invited -> active by ANY proven sign-in; `staff_invites.accepted_at` was
written only by `POST /companies/invites/{token}/accept`, reached by clicking
the emailed link. An invitee who signed in directly showed Active and Pending
at once, for ever.

WHAT IS PINNED HERE
-------------------
* `services/staff_invites.accept_pending_invite` touches only a genuinely
  pending row, and audits the acceptance in one insert;
* both session-issuing paths call it (the Firebase exchange and the
  workspace chooser), read back from a SECOND connection;
* the /join page's own second step, which posts the acceptance AFTER the
  sign-in that already accepted it, is answered as accepted, not as a spent
  link, and moves nothing.

Every assertion reads committed state from a second session, because a write
that answered and rolled back is invisible to an assertion on a return value.
