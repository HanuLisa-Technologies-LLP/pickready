"""Owner decision D4: a session recording is purged at whichever comes first,
90 days after the session or the job-closure purge.

"Both deadlines are stored or derived, never a moving constant", and the
promise is kept by three things this file pins together:

  * the recording's own date, `media_purge_due_at`, STAMPED once when the
    recording is finalized, so a settings change never moves a deadline a
    candidate was already given;
  * the closure date, `jobs.assessment_purge_due_at`, read at SWEEP time, so a
    job closed after the recording was stamped still wins;
  * the hourly sweep that deletes HEAD-confirmed, leaves the row as the record
    that a recording existed, and counts a failure instead of reporting a
    deletion it did not see;

plus the retry pass for raw segments whose deletion did not confirm, and the
S3 half of the same promise in `infra/modules/s3`, which is only the backstop.
