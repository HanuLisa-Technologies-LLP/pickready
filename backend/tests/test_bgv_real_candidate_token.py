"""The candidate's BGV routes, called the way a browser calls them.

THE DEFECT THIS PINS
--------------------
Every `/bgv/me*` route declared `get_current_user` (staff audiences only)
beside `get_candidate_db` (candidate audience only). No token satisfies both,
so every real candidate got a 401 and Employment History was unreachable for
the whole life of the feature. Every test passed regardless, because every
test overrode BOTH dependencies and so never asked the question a browser
asks.

WHAT IS REAL HERE
-----------------
Nothing is overridden. The candidate is signed in by `tests/candidate_session`,
which writes the rows through `candidate_identity.link_on_sign_in` and the
session record through `auth._issue_session`, so the cookie carries a real
`sid` backed by a real Redis hash. The staff token is minted by the same
function under the ORG audience. Writes are read back on a SECOND connection
after the response, because a write that answered 200 and rolled back at commit
is invisible to an assertion on the response body.

Mutation check: restoring `get_current_user` on any `/bgv/me*` route turns its
status here into 401.
