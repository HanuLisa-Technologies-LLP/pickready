"""Every sentence a recruiter or a candidate can read (spec 7.1, 7.3, 7.4, 8.3).

    "Never appears in recruiter-facing output: strike, tier, violation, flag,
     anomaly, signal, confidence, threshold, severity, event type codes, model
     names, confidence percentages, character counts, millisecond timings, or
     any phrasing implying the candidate cheated."

THE SWEEP IS THE POINT. Reading three example sentences proves nothing about
the fourth, so this file GENERATES every sentence the library can produce, at
every count and every duration bucket, and checks all of them. A template
added without the word "flag" in it is a template a test has already read.

The second half is that the sentences say something. A library that returned
the empty string would pass every prohibition, so each generator is also
asserted to name the thing that happened and, where the specification says so,
what the system did about it.
