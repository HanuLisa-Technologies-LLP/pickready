"""What the auth hardening removed stays removed (auth spec 2.6, 9, 11.4).

* The browser no longer changes or resets a password. Firebase's own reset
  email (`sendPasswordResetEmail`) went around the CAPTCHA and the security
  code, and the browser-side change (`updatePassword` after
  `reauthenticateWithCredential`) needed a second call to revoke sessions,
  which is why the route that took a fresh Firebase token to revoke them
  existed. The server changes the password now and revokes in the same
  request, so all three are gone, route included.
* The session exchange takes a CAPTCHA purpose, and the purpose IS the portal
  intent; the separate `requested_portal` field is gone.
* No company surface offers Google: the invitation page, and the company
  sign-in page, carry no Google button.

`tests/removal_sweep.py` is the one sweep, whitespace normalised.
