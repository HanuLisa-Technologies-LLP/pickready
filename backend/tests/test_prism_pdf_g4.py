"""The PDF route runs gate G4: a flagged report is not downloaded until a person decides.

PLAN-p5 P5-D7. `siddhi.delivery` had no production caller, so the PDF route
rendered every report, flagged or not, straight through the renderer and G4
guarded nothing a client received. The route now takes the clearance G4 mints
and answers 409 with the server's own sentence while a flagged report has no
recorded human disposition. The on-screen report is not gated (it is where
that person reads the report), and that is asserted too.

Reuses the retention-consent fixture: the download already needs the
candidate's explicit Yes, and this file adds the second gate on top of it.
