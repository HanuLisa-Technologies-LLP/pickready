 * ReadyPick before every profile reached a customer; no such step exists, and
 * the human in the loop is the customer's own team, which the product
 * enforces (no flag rejects anybody, a person decides). "A flat job
 * subscription" was the pricing model before credits: a customer buys credits
 * and spends them per completed PRISM Report.

              Before ReadyPick, Recruitrix.ai brought profiles, assessments, verification and delivery into one platform when many teams were still assembling those pieces separately. Its remote-ready model supported more than 60 customers across India, delivered more than 10,000 jobs and led to an acquisition.
            </p>
            <p>
              The market moved. AI matured, candidate expectations changed and people teams needed more control over how evidence becomes a decision. ReadyPick takes the practical lessons from that journey and rebuilds the operating model from first principles.
            </p>
            <p>
              ReadyPick turns the job&apos;s skills, the evidence in each resume and one proctored assessment into one clear assessment trail, so teams can spend interview time on the questions that matter.

                Manjunath spent more than 25 years in HR - as a practitioner, transformation leader and builder of the platform he believed the function was missing.
              </p>
              <p>
                He reviewed more than 600 HR technology platforms, advised over 50 companies on where their people processes break and mentored more than 100 HR professionals. Those conversations shaped a simple standard: technology should give time back, not add another system to manage.

              <p>
                ReadyPick is not a side project. It is the operating belief that teams deserve clear evidence, candidates deserve clarity and the final decision must stay human.
