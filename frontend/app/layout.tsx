/**
 * The faces every route needs (DESIGN.md section 3). The third face, Hubot
 * Sans, is the marketing display face and is bound in `app/display-font.ts`
 * by the two public frames only, so no product route downloads it.
 *
 *  - Mona Sans is the working face: body, navigation, forms, tables, dialogs,
 *    reports, product page titles and most marketing copy. `body` carries it,
 *    so a component gets it without asking. It replaced Inter Tight on
 *    2026-09-28; it is a touch wider, so a label that fit before is not
 *    assumed to fit now.
 *  - Geist Mono carries reference codes, system identifiers, URLs and code.
 *    Nothing else: ordinary metadata stays in Mona Sans with tabular numerals.
 *
 * Both are variable fonts (one file per subset carries every weight) and are
 * SIL Open Font License 1.1, which permits commercial use and self-hosting.
 * next/font downloads them at BUILD time and serves them from this origin, so
 * no request reaches a font CDN at runtime and the CSP's `font-src 'self'`
 * holds. It also emits a metric-matched fallback face, which is what keeps the
 * swap from shifting layout.
