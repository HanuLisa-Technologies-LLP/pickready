// My Profile, the candidate's single, unified profile (client decision,
// 2026-07-27). It replaced the old "Settings" page and holds everything a
// candidate maintains about themselves in one place:
//
//   * account details and, for password accounts, the password;
//   * the MAIN resume, uploadable and re-uploadable at any time;
//   * their employment history and its background verification, and the
//     academic and address documents a fresher provides instead;
//   * the profile form, answered once here instead of per application;
//   * their consents: keeping the profile, retention choices, and the full
//     record of what they agreed to and when;
//   * the appearance toggle (the only place it lives, claude.md rule 10).
//
// Role is deliberately not shown: a candidate has exactly one.
//
// Order is by how often a card is used, and the destructive card is last.
