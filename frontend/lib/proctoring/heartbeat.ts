/**
 * The heartbeat (proctoring spec section 9).
 *
 * Every `heartbeat_interval_seconds` the client tells the server it is still
 * there, whether the last identity check matched, and what its own
 * monitoring self-check found. A gap longer than the server's allowance is
 * recorded there as a monitoring interruption and appears in the report,
 * which is the honest alternative to a clean report for a period nobody was
 * watching. The next interval comes back on the response, so the server can
 * slow a client down without a deploy.
 *
 * A failed post is not retried early: the following beat is the retry, and a
 * gap that opens because the network was down is exactly what the server is
 * supposed to record.
 *
 * Each answer also carries the server's clock and the device pause (Phase 3,
 * 2026-09-24). Both are handed to `onResult` with the moments the request left
 * and the answer arrived, so the session can place the server's grace deadline
 * on this device's clock: the countdown a candidate watches is the server's
 * deadline, not one this client started.
