// into memory in one request. Now each segment is one multipart upload on the
// server: parts of at least `part_min_bytes` (the object store's floor for
// every part but the last) and at most `part_max_bytes` are PUT as they fill,
// and a new segment starts whenever the devices are reacquired after a loss,
// because a recorder bound to a camera that went away cannot continue into the
// one that came back. The server stitches the segments in order when the
// recording is finalized. No bucket name and no object key crosses this
// boundary, in either direction.
