/**
 * The events this client may emit, mirrored from
 * `backend/app/services/proctoring/catalog.py` (the entries with
 * `client_emittable=True`) with the consequence path the server assigns to
 * each.
 *
 * THE SERVER DECIDES. The path is carried here for ONE reason: an event on
 * Path A or Path P is flushed the moment it is queued rather than on the next
 * batch tick (`isImmediate`), because the session is about to end or pause and
 * the candidate should learn that from a screen and not from a request that
 * lands seconds later. The client never acts on a path itself; it requests,
 * the server issues.
 *
 * `lib/proctoring/model-assets.test.ts` reads the Python catalog and asserts
 * this table names exactly the client-emittable identifiers, so an event
 * added on one side without the other fails a test rather than a request.
