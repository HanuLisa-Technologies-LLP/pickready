/**
 * The browser-side thresholds, exactly as the session response carries them.
 *
 * Every number the client's detectors, timers and capture use comes from
 * `SessionOut.config`, which the server projects from ONE frozen
 * `ProctoringConfig` (`services/proctoring/config.CLIENT_FIELDS`). A detector
 * that carried its own confidence threshold would drift from the one the
 * server records against the event, and the report would describe a rule
 * nobody was applying. So no module under `lib/proctoring/` holds a threshold
 * of its own; each takes the figure it needs from this object.
 *
 * `parseClientConfig` refuses a response missing any field rather than
 * substituting a default. A default here is a second copy of a number that
 * lives on the server, and the two would disagree the first time an operator
 * moved one of them.
 *
 * `lib/proctoring/model-assets.test.ts` reads the Python `CLIENT_FIELDS`
 * tuple and asserts `CLIENT_CONFIG_FIELDS` names the same set.
 *
 * `device_glitch_seconds` REPLACED `camera_recovery_seconds` (Phase 3,
 * 2026-09-24). The old figure decided when a dead camera became a Path A
 * termination; a lost device now pauses the assessment instead, and the one
 * number the browser needs is how long a stream may be gone before the loss
 * is reported as one. A drop shorter than that is a glitch and is logged as
 * such; anything longer opens the server's pause. The grace and the pause
 * allowance are NOT here: they arrive as the server's `pause` state (its
 * deadline, its count and its sentence), because the client decides neither.
