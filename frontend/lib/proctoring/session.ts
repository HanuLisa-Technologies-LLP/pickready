/**
 * The running monitoring session: every detector wired to the one event
 * queue, the one heartbeat and the one self-check.
 *
 * `ProctoringShell` owns the screens; this owns the machinery so the shell
 * stays a state machine over four phases. Everything here is started by
 * `start()` and released by `stop()`, and `stop()` is the only place media is
 * released: a session that ends for any reason, completion, termination or a
 * closed tab, stops every track and terminates both workers.
 *
 * The self-check's four answers come from the parts themselves: the camera's
 * track state, the microphone's track state, the inference client having
 * answered within one heartbeat interval, and the lockdown and focus handles
 * still being installed. Each is a check on the machinery, not on the
 * candidate; the header of lockdown.ts says what that is worth.
 *
 * THE DEVICE PAUSE (Phase 3, 2026-09-24). A lost camera or microphone is no
 * longer an ending. The monitors report the loss to `DeviceWatch`, which turns
 * it into the events the server pauses on; the server's answer (`pause`, on
 * every ingest and heartbeat response) is combined with what this client can
 * see locally into a `PauseView`, and the shell renders the pause screen from
 * that and from nothing else. Three things here exist only because of it:
 *
 *   - THE INTEGRITY CHECK DOES NOT COUNT A DEVICE THE PAUSE ALREADY OWNS. Its
 *     episode rule would otherwise report INTEGRITY_CHECK_FAILED, a Path A
 *     termination, sixty seconds into a two-minute grace, and the candidate
 *     who was promised two minutes would get one. The HEARTBEAT still reports
 *     the device down, because it is down.
 *   - THE DETECTORS FORGET THE OUTAGE (`DetectionRules.resetPresence`), for
 *     the same reason: time without a camera is not time without a face.
 *   - THE SERVER'S CLOCK. The grace deadline is a server timestamp, placed on
 *     this device's clock with the offset each heartbeat measures, so a
 *     candidate whose clock is wrong still sees the true time left.
 *
 * ONE BLOCKED ATTEMPT, ONE EVENT, ONE COUNT. Copy, cut, paste and drop can be
 * caught in two places: the lockdown's listeners on the document, and an
 * answer field's own handlers. The lockdown runs first, in the capture phase,
 * and stops the event, so in practice the field never sees it; the lockdown
 * path therefore both emits the event and counts it against the answer on
 * screen. The field path does the same for an attempt the document did not
 * catch. Should both ever see one attempt, the field defers: the lockdown
 * marks the action for the rest of the current dispatch (cleared in a
 * microtask, which runs only after every synchronous handler of that event),
 * and a field report of the same action inside that window is the same
 * attempt, already recorded.
