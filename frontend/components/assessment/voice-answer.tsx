// A spoken answer to a prose question (Appendix B section 3).
//
//   idle -> starting -> recording -> uploading -> transcribing -> transcribed
//                  \           \           \                  \-> failed
//                   `-----------`-----------`-> unavailable
//
// TWO KINDS OF FAILURE, BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF THEM HOLDS THE CLOCK. `failed` is
// the server's: the audio arrived, transcription did not work, and the server
// holds a pause open until the candidate has read that and acknowledged it.
// `unavailable` never reached the server (no microphone, a refused upload, a
// recorder that died): no pause was opened, so there is nothing to
// acknowledge and the typing box is offered at once.
//
// THE TRANSCRIPT IS THE ANSWER, AND IT IS FINAL. Amazon Transcribe turns the
// recording into text on the server; that text is what is evaluated, it is
// shown here read-only, and the player submits it without offering an edit.
// There is no edit route on the server either, so a hand-built request cannot
// do what this screen does not offer. Only the text is kept: the audio object
// is deleted once transcribed, and the session recording is the one place the
// candidate's voice lives.
//
// ENGLISH ONLY, AT MOST THE SERVER'S LIMIT. The begin call returns the longest
// capture the server accepts and the recorder stops itself there, so the
// limit a candidate reads and the limit the server enforces are one number.
//
// A FAILURE SWITCHES THIS ANSWER TO TYPING, AND THE CLOCK WAITED. From upload
// until the transcript (or the failure) the server holds the turn's clock
// still. On a failure the candidate is told plainly, acknowledging closes the
// server's pause, and the player offers the typing box for this turn only.
// Nothing here ever presents an empty or invented transcript as what was said.
//
// THE MICROPHONE CAPTURE IS OPENED BEFORE THE SERVER ROW. A browser that will
// not give up the microphone never creates a capture record the server would
// then have to treat as an open spoken answer.
