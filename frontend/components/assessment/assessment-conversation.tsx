// The assessment, one question at a time (Appendix B sections 1 to 3).
//
// ONE MODE. Every candidate takes the same proctored, question-by-question
// assessment: prose answered by typing or speaking, multiple choice and
// fill-in-the-blank by clicking and typing, coding in the editor. The format
// on screen comes from the server's `question`, and the answer field is
// whatever `QuestionRenderer` dispatches for it.
//
// FIXED ORDER, AND THE SERVER NAMES THE TURN. Only the current turn is
// answerable. Every submission carries the server's `turn_seq`, and a
// submission naming a turn that is no longer current is refused with a 409 and
// writes nothing, so a retry after a lost response is never filed as the
// answer to the next question. The answers already given are shown read-only
// from the server's own `history`; there is no edit control because there is
// no edit route.
//
// THE CLOCK IS THE SERVER'S. The countdown renders the server's deadline; the
// draft is sent to the server as the candidate works, because on expiry the
// server submits what it holds; and reaching zero here first re-reads the
// server's clock, because a pause this browser did not see (a warning, a
// camera recovery, a transcription) may have moved the deadline. Nothing this
// component measures is sent as time. An empty answer submitted by the clock
// is recorded by the server as an evidence gap, and it says so.
//
// Rendered INSIDE `components/proctoring/proctoring-shell`, which owns consent
// to monitoring, the system check and the monitoring session, and hands this
// component the `ProctoringBridge` through `useProctoring()`. There is no
// unmonitored mode and the page never mounts this outside the shell.
