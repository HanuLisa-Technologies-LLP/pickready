// The proctoring shell: the four screens a monitored assessment passes
// through, and the owner of the monitoring session behind them.
//
//   consenting -> checking -> active -> ended
//
// CONSENT FIRST, ALWAYS. Nothing opens a device or creates a session until
// the candidate has pressed "I understand and agree" (spec 8.1). The system
// check runs next and the assessment cannot begin until every row passes
// (spec 8.2). Only then is a session created, the detectors started and the
// children mounted, so there is no moment at which a question is on screen
// without monitoring. Proctoring is mandatory and this component has no other
// branch: a failure to start the session is a screen that says so and offers
// a retry, never an unmonitored assessment.
//
// WHAT THE CHILDREN SEE. A `ProctoringBridge`, and nothing else. The player
// reads the warning count for its own display, asks for field hooks per
// question, collects the timings when it submits, reads whether the
// assessment is held still (`paused`), and tells the shell when the
// conversation ended. It never touches a detector and no detector knows the
// player exists.
//
// THE SERVER DECIDES. Every warning, every pause and every termination on
// these screens arrived on a response. This component counts nothing and
// concludes nothing: the pause screen renders the server's deadline and the
// server's count, and a warning's hold on the question timer is the server's
// to measure (the acknowledgement tells it when the hold ended).
//
// THE RULES COME FROM THE SERVER (Phase 3, 2026-09-24). The consent screen
// used to carry seven hard-coded statements; it now renders the server's
// `candidate_rules`, and the shell will not offer the agreement until they
// have loaded.
