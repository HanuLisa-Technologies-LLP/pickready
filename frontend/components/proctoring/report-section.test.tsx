// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// The Proctoring Report inside the PRISM Report (proctoring spec section 7).
//
// Three properties, and the last is the one this file exists for:
//
//  1. It is the LAST section. It is informational, it moves no grade, and it
//     sits after everything that does.
//  2. A report that does not exist says so in one line rather than rendering
//     an empty heading, because a blank section reads as a clean session.
//  3. NO ICON, NO COLOUR CODE, NO SEVERITY COLUMN, and none of the internal
//     vocabulary (spec 7.1). Importance comes from what is said and where it
//     sits; a tinted chip beside a finding would state a judgement the system
//     is explicitly not entitled to make.
