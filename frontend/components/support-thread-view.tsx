// The shared pieces of a support conversation, used by BOTH portals.
//
// A thread reads identically to the person who raised it and to the person
// answering it: same messages, same order, same three states. What differs is
// what surrounds it, and that lives in each portal's own screen. Rendering the
// conversation twice would be two answers to "what does this thread say", and
// the first divergence would be a customer and a support agent each believing
// they were looking at the same page.
//
// NAVY IS STRUCTURE, TEAL IS EVIDENCE. There is no evidence on this screen: a
// support thread carries no citation, no grade and nothing corroborated. So it
// is plain navy and neutral throughout, and teal is deliberately unused rather
// than spent on a status chip it would only decorate. Teal means something in
// this product; spending it here would cost it that meaning everywhere else.
