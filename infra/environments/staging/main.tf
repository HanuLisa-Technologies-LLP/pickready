/**
 * ReadyPick STAGING.
 *
 * Composes every module. Two environment roots rather than one root with a
 * workspace, and that is deliberate: a `terraform.workspace` conditional means
 * one plan file describes two environments, and the moment somebody runs the
 * wrong workspace the blast radius is production. Two directories means the
 * production plan cannot be produced by accident from the staging one.
 *
 * WHAT STAGING IS FOR, AND THEREFORE WHAT IS SMALLER HERE
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * Staging exists to prove a deploy works, not to survive an AZ failure. So:
 * one NAT gateway, no RDS Multi-AZ, no Redis replica, one task per service,
 * seven-day backups, no deletion protection. Every one of those is a cost
 * decision and every one is stated in this file rather than defaulted, so the
 * production file's differences are readable as a diff.
 *
 * READ `infra/environments/README.md` BEFORE RUNNING ANYTHING. spec-doc5 §D.1
 * is explicit that this phase produces a codebase that is buildable and
 * planable but that NO LIVE DEPLOYMENT IS EXECUTED -- and it makes that a
 * pass/fail criterion in the opposite direction from usual.

# ── The bill ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# THERE WAS NO BUDGET AND NO BILLING ALARM ANYWHERE IN THIS REPOSITORY, in any
# environment, before 2026-09-17.
#
# That gap is not the same shape as a missing operational alarm. Every alarm
# above watches something that breaks loudly; cost does the opposite. A runaway
# NAT gateway, a Fargate service that scaled up and never came back down, a
# model-calling task retrying in a loop, an S3 prefix whose lifecycle rule does
# not reach it -- all of them look exactly like a working system, for a whole
# month, until an invoice arrives. This platform already runs several things
# that cannot scale to zero (Fargate says so in its own module comment), so the
# floor is real and the ceiling is unwatched.
#
# THE LIMIT IS A VARIABLE AND ITS DEFAULT IS NOT A JUDGEMENT ABOUT THIS
# ENVIRONMENT. Read `var.monthly_budget_usd`: it is deliberately conservative
# so that an unset value alerts EARLY and noisily rather than late and quietly,
# and the owner is expected to replace it with a real number.
#
# NO COST FILTER, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
#
# The obvious refinement is to scope the budget to this environment's resources
# with a `TagKeyValue` filter on `Environment`. It is not used, because a cost
# allocation tag has to be ACTIVATED in the Billing console before it appears
# in cost data at all, and Terraform cannot do that. A filter on an
# unactivated tag matches nothing, so the budget reports a spend of zero and
# never notifies -- a billing alarm that is silent because it is misconfigured
# is worse than none, since it also stops anybody from looking.
#
# So this measures the ACCOUNT. If the three environments share one account,
# all three budgets watch the same total and the owner will get duplicate
# notifications at the lowest limit of the three: noisy, visible, and safe.
# Separate accounts per environment is the real answer, and adding the tag
# filter is correct the day somebody has activated the tag and can say so.
