/**
 * ReadyPick PILOT, in ap-south-2.
 *
 * The first environment of the Lambda-plus-on-demand-ECS architecture, and the
 * first one this repository has ever actually applied. Staging and production
 * next door describe the Celery topology this replaced; they are kept because
 * they are the record of what was deployed before, and they are NOT the shape
 * to copy. Copy this one.
 *
 * WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ENVIRONMENTS BESIDE IT
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * There is no `worker` service and no `beat` service. The work they did is now:
 *
 *   short work        `readypick-task-worker`, a Lambda. Delivery, resume
 *                     parsing, the reconciliation sweeps. Billed per
 *                     invocation, so an idle platform costs nothing for it.
 *   long work         `readypick-agent`, an ECS task definition with NO
 *                     SERVICE. A Lambda calls RunTask when work arrives; the
 *                     container does one piece of work and exits. Fargate does
 *                     not scale to zero, which is exactly why this is a task
 *                     definition and not a service.
 *   the schedule      EventBridge Scheduler rules, one per sweep, invoking the
 *                     task worker with the payload a dispatch would have sent.
 *                     No singleton process to lose.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A NEW `terraform/` TREE
 * ----------------------------------------
 * The infrastructure brief asks for `terraform/` at the repository root. This
 * repository already had a complete Terraform tree under `infra/`, with eleven
 * modules, an offline planning profile, a wildcard-IAM checker and CI wiring,
 * all of which this environment reuses. A second tree would be two answers to
 * "where is the infrastructure", and the older one is the one CI reads.
 * Recorded in DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md.
 *
 * WHAT AN APPLY OF THIS FILE DOES NOT GIVE YOU
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * Secrets are created EMPTY. Every model credential, the JWT signing key and
 * the Hugging Face token are containers with no value until a human runs
 * `aws secretsmanager put-secret-value`. A service started against an empty
 * secret starts and fails on first use, so the deploy order in
 * DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md puts the secrets before the services deliberately.

  # the MX record and the apex's MX belongs to whatever mailbox the company
  # actually reads. Empty without a domain, and that is a real state: the
  # deployment still SENDS verification requests, and the employer's reply
  # arrives in the sending mailbox instead of in the thread. The application
  # records that rather than hiding it (`conversations.reply_address`).

  # PILOT IS IN ONE OF THE GAPS. `ap-south-2` sends perfectly well;
  # `describe-active-receipt-rule-set` answers `InvalidAction` there because the
  # API is absent, and `inbound-smtp.ap-south-2.amazonaws.com` does not resolve
  # at all. Applying the module here would publish an MX record pointing at a
  # hostname with no address: every employer's reply would bounce at their own
  # mail server, and nothing in this account would log it.
  #
  # So inbound stays OFF here until the receiving half is moved to a region
  # that has it (`ap-south-1` is verified and holds no active rule set), which
  # needs a provider alias and a second `lambda` instance in that region. The
  # module refuses the wrong region by validation, so this cannot be turned on
  # by editing one boolean.
  #
  # THE CONSEQUENCE IS STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. With no inbound domain the
  # product sets no Reply-To, `conversations.reply_address` records that once,
  # and an employer's reply arrives in the sending mailbox instead of in the
  # thread. That is a real, working, degraded mode. Advertising a Reply-To that

  # proctoring feature no assessment has ever exercised here. Autoscaling
  # CEILINGS are unchanged or higher, so behaviour under real load is
  # preserved: target tracking (CPU 65) grows each service toward its
  # max_count and shrinks it back, and rolling deploys still start the new
  # task before draining the old, so a deploy is not an outage. What IS

  # t4g.medium, up from t4g.micro (2026-09-10). Two reasons, and neither is
  # raw connection count. 1GB of RAM is not comfortable working memory for
  # pgvector HNSW index operations once real candidates land, and RDS derives
  # its default max_connections from instance memory, so the bump also lifts
  # the connection ceiling roughly fourfold against Lambda concurrency spikes
  # (worker_session builds a fresh engine per invocation by design, so Lambda
  # concurrency, not the app pool size, is what actually drives peak
  # connections here).
  #
  # AN RDS PROXY WAS EVALUATED AND DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT (owner decision,
  # 2026-09-10). The AWS pinning documentation settles it: for PostgreSQL the
  # proxy pins a session on any SET command, on set_config(), and on named
  # prepared statements. This application issues SET LOCAL ROLE inside every
  # tenant-scoped transaction (core/db.tenant_scope), a session-level
  # set_config on every worker connection (workers/runtime.worker_session),
  # and asyncpg caches prepared statements by default, so effectively every
  # session would pin immediately: no multiplexing, a held backend connection
  # per client for its whole lifetime, and the one benefit left is queuing
  # connection storms. Revisit only if CloudWatch DatabaseConnections ever
  # approaches the instance ceiling; the fix that makes a proxy worthwhile is
  # an application change (transaction-scoped worker bypass, statement cache
  # off), not a Terraform change.

# ── The bill ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# THERE WAS NO BUDGET AND NO BILLING ALARM ANYWHERE IN THIS REPOSITORY, in any
# environment, before 2026-09-17.
#
# That gap is not the same shape as a missing operational alarm. Every alarm
# above watches something that breaks loudly; cost does the opposite. A runaway
# NAT gateway, a Fargate service that scaled up and never came back down, a
# model-calling task retrying in a loop, an S3 prefix whose lifecycle rule does
# not reach it -- all of them look exactly like a working system, for a whole
# month, until an invoice arrives. This platform already runs several things
# that cannot scale to zero (Fargate says so in its own module comment), so the
# floor is real and the ceiling is unwatched.
#
# THE LIMIT IS A VARIABLE AND ITS DEFAULT IS NOT A JUDGEMENT ABOUT THIS
# ENVIRONMENT. Read `var.monthly_budget_usd`: it is deliberately conservative
# so that an unset value alerts EARLY and noisily rather than late and quietly,
# and the owner is expected to replace it with a real number.
#
# NO COST FILTER, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
#
# The obvious refinement is to scope the budget to this environment's resources
# with a `TagKeyValue` filter on `Environment`. It is not used, because a cost
# allocation tag has to be ACTIVATED in the Billing console before it appears
# in cost data at all, and Terraform cannot do that. A filter on an
# unactivated tag matches nothing, so the budget reports a spend of zero and
# never notifies -- a billing alarm that is silent because it is misconfigured
# is worse than none, since it also stops anybody from looking.
#
# So this measures the ACCOUNT. If the three environments share one account,
# all three budgets watch the same total and the owner will get duplicate
# notifications at the lowest limit of the three: noisy, visible, and safe.
# Separate accounts per environment is the real answer, and adding the tag
# filter is correct the day somebody has activated the tag and can say so.
