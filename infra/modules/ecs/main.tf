/**
 * ECS Fargate: the cluster, the services, and the per-service IAM roles.
 *
 * FARGATE, because spec-doc5 §D.3 names it as "the direct equivalent of the
 * Cloud Run model this platform is migrating from" -- and it is: a container,
 * a request, no host to patch. The one thing it is not equivalent on is
 * scale-to-zero, and that is called out in the autoscaling block below rather
 * than discovered later on a bill.
 *
 * ONE TASK ROLE PER SERVICE. THIS IS THE POINT OF THE MODULE.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * spec-doc5 §D.4: "IAM policies must be scoped per-service, not a shared broad
 * role -- the DATABASE_URL exposure finding from the GCP phase (a composed DSN
 * readable via a broad permission) is the exact class of mistake to design out
 * here from the start rather than harden later."
 *
 * So `var.services` is a map, and each entry gets:
 *
 *   its own TASK ROLE       what the running code can do
 *   its own EXECUTION ROLE  what the ECS agent can do on its behalf
 *   its own secret policy   from the `secrets` module, enumerated per service
 *
 * The two roles are separate because they are used at different times by
 * different principals, and conflating them is the usual mistake: the execution
 * role pulls the image and fetches secrets to INJECT, before the container
 * starts; the task role is what the application's own AWS SDK calls use. A
 * single role means the application can read every secret the platform injects,
 * whether or not it was given one.
 *
 * SECRETS ARE INJECTED BY ECS, NOT COMPOSED BY THE APPLICATION.
 * The `secrets` block on the container definition makes ECS fetch the value and
 * set the environment variable. That is what "mounted rather than composed into
 * a loggable env var where the platform allows it" means here -- the value never
 * passes through a shell, a startup script or a log line on its way in.
 *
 * THE WORKER AND BEAT RUN THE SAME IMAGE WITH A DIFFERENT COMMAND, which is why
 * `command` is per-service and the image is not. They are separate SERVICES
 * rather than separate containers in one task because they scale differently:
 * the worker scales on queue depth and beat must be exactly one, forever.
