# EventBridge Scheduler: the periodic sweeps that used to be Celery beat.
#
# WHY THIS REPLACED A PROCESS
# ---------------------------
# Beat was a container that had to be running, had to be exactly one, and whose
# failure mode was silence. Nothing fires, nothing errors, and the only symptom
# is a reconciliation sweep that quietly stopped repairing things -- which for
# this product means jobs stuck at `questions_pending_review` with no framework,
# abandoned assessments never settled, and temporary project originals never
# deleted. A managed scheduler has no process to lose and no singleton to
# guarantee.
#
# EventBridge SCHEDULER rather than an EventBridge RULE. A rule is a bus
# subscription with a target; a schedule is a first-class object with its own
# retry policy, its own flexible time window and a real one-time mode. The
# retry policy is the one that matters here: it is set to ZERO attempts, for
# the same reason the Lambda async config is, so the retry loop inside
# `app.workers.runtime` stays the only owner of retries.
#
# THE LIST IS NOT AUTHORED HERE
# -----------------------------
# `app/workers/schedule.py` is the source of truth, and
# `backend/tests/test_schedule_parity.py` reads both this file and that module
# and fails if they disagree. Two copies of one fact stay honest only when
# something compares them, which is the discipline `test_runbook_parity.py`
# already applies to the hiring weights. Adding a schedule means editing both,
# and the test is what makes that a rule rather than a habit.
