/**
 * VPC, subnets and security groups (spec-doc5 §D.4).
 *
 * THE SUBNET SPLIT IS THE SECURITY BOUNDARY, and every other module in this
 * layout depends on it being right:
 *
 *   public   NAT gateways and the load balancer. Nothing else.
 *   private  ECS tasks. Egress through NAT, no inbound from the internet.
 *   data     RDS and ElastiCache. NO ROUTE TO THE INTERNET AT ALL -- not even
 *            outbound through NAT.
 *
 * That third tier is the one worth arguing for, because two tiers is the common
 * shape and it is nearly as good. A database subnet with a NAT route can still
 * be reached OUTWARD from a compromised host, which is exactly the path an
 * exfiltration takes: the attacker does not need to reach the database from the
 * internet, they need the database's host to reach them. Removing the route
 * removes the path.
 *
 * SECURITY GROUPS REFERENCE EACH OTHER, NEVER CIDR BLOCKS. `rds` accepts 5432
 * from the ECS security group's ID, not from `10.0.0.0/16`. A CIDR rule says
 * "anything that happens to be in this address range", which includes whatever
 * gets deployed into that VPC next year; a group reference says "the thing that
 * runs the application", which is what was meant.

# it is easy to leave alone: it is invisible until the day somebody launches a
# resource without naming a security group, and AWS silently attaches it to this
# one. At that point the resource has unrestricted access to every other
# resource that made the same mistake, and no rule anybody wrote says so.
#
# Managing it here with no rules at all makes the default deny rather than
# allow. It is not deleted, because AWS does not permit deleting it.

# it means a question asked after an incident -- "did anything reach the data
# subnet, and from where" -- has no answer at all without this.
#
# REJECT and ACCEPT both, not just REJECT. A rejected packet tells you somebody
# tried; an accepted one tells you what a compromised host actually reached, and
